</div>
<p class='c003'>The essays collected in this volume have been written
during the past eight years. They deal with various aspects
of the subject of mysticism: the first half-dozen with its
general theory and practice, and special points arising within
it; the rest with its application as seen in the lives and works
of the mystics, from the pagan Plotinus to the Christian contemplatives
of our own day. Most of them have already
appeared elsewhere, though all have been revised and several
completely re-written for the purposes of this book. “The
Essentials of Mysticism” and “The Mystic as Creative
Artist” were first printed in <i>The Quest</i>; “The Mystic and
the Corporate Life,” “Mysticism and the Doctrine of Atonement,”
and “The Place of Will, Intellect, and Feeling in
Prayer” in <i>The Interpreter</i>; “The Education of the Spirit”
in <i>The Parents’ Review</i>; “The Mysticism of Plotinus” in
<i>The Quarterly Review</i>; “The Mirror of Simple Souls” and
“Sœur Thérèse de l’Enfant-Jésus” (under the title of “A
Modern Saint”) in <i>The Fortnightly Review</i>; “The Blessed
Angela of Foligno” in <i>Franciscan Essays</i>; “Julian of
Norwich” in <i>The St. Martin’s Review</i>; and “Charles Péguy”
in <i>The Contemporary Review</i>. All these are now republished
by kind permission of the editors concerned.</p>

  <h2 id='chap01' class='c004'>THE ESSENTIALS OF MYSTICISM</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'>What are the true essentials of mysticism? When we
have stripped off those features which some mystics accept
and some reject—all that is merely due to tradition, temperament
or unconscious allegorism—what do we find as the
necessary and abiding character of all true mystical experience?
This question is really worth asking. For some time much
attention has been given to the historical side of mysticism,
and some—much less—to its practice. But there has been
no clear understanding of the difference between its substance
and its accidents: between traditional forms and methods,
and the eternal experience which they have mediated. In
mystical literature words are frequently confused with things,
and symbols with realities; so that much of this literature
seems to the reader to refer to some self-consistent and exclusive
dream-world, and not to the achievement of universal
truth. Thus the strong need for re-statement which is being
felt by institutional religion, the necessity of re-translating
its truths into symbolism which modern men can understand
and accept, applies with at least equal force to mysticism.
It has become important to disentangle the facts from ancient
formulæ used to express them. These formulæ have value,
because they are genuine attempts to express truth; but
they are not themselves that truth, and failure to recognize
this distinction has caused a good deal of misunderstanding.
Thus, on its philosophic and theological side, the mysticism
of western Europe is tightly entwined with the patristic and
mediæval presentation of Christianity; and this presentation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>though full of noble poetry, is now difficult if not impossible
to adjust to our conceptions of the Universe. Again, on its
personal side mysticism is a department of psychology.
Now psychology is changing under our eyes; already we see
our mental life in a new perspective, tend to describe it under
new forms. Our ways of describing and interpreting spiritual
experience must change with the rest, if we are to keep in touch
with reality; though the experience itself be unchanged.</p>

<p class='c005'>So we are forced to ask ourselves, what is the essential
element in spiritual experience? Which of the many states
and revelations described by the mystics are integral parts
of it; and what do these states and degrees come to, when
we describe them in the current phraseology and strip off
the monastic robes in which they are usually dressed? What
elements are due to the suggestions of tradition, to conscious
or unconscious symbolism, to the misinterpretation of emotion,
to the invasion of cravings from the lower centres, or the
disguised fulfilment of an unconscious wish? And when all
these channels of illusion have been blocked, what is left?
This will be a difficult and often a painful enquiry. But it
is an enquiry which ought to be faced by all who believe
in the validity of man’s spiritual experience; in order that
their faith may be established on a firm basis, and disentangled
from those unreal and impermanent elements which are
certainly destined to destruction, and with which it is at
present too often confused. I am sure that at the present
moment we serve best the highest interests of the soul by
subjecting the whole mass of material which is called “mysticism”
to an inexorable criticism. Only by inflicting the
faithful wounds of a friend can we save the science of the
inner life from mutilation at the hands of the psychologists.</p>

<p class='c005'>We will begin, then, with the central fact of the mystic’s
experience. This central fact, it seems to me, is an overwhelming
consciousness of God and of his own soul: a consciousness
which absorbs or eclipses all other centres of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>interest. It is said that <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Francis of Assisi, praying in the
house of Bernard of Quintavalle, was heard to say again and
again: “My God! my God! what art Thou? and what
am I?” Though the words come from <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Augustine, they
well represent his mental attitude. This was the only question
which he thought worth asking; and it is the question
which every mystic asks at the beginning and sometimes
answers at the end of his quest. Hence we must put first
among our essentials the clear conviction of a living God
as the primary interest of consciousness, and of a personal
self capable of communion with Him. Having said this,
however, we may allow that the widest latitude is possible
in the mystic’s conception of his Deity. At best this conception
will be symbolic; his experience, if genuine, will far
transcend the symbols he employs. “God,” says the author
of <i>The Cloud of Unknowing</i>, “may well be loved but not
thought.” Credal forms, therefore, can only be for the
mystic a scaffold by which he ascends. We are even bound,
I think, to confess that the overt recognition of that which
orthodox Christians generally mean by a personal God is not
essential. On the contrary, where it takes a crudely anthropomorphic
form, the idea of personality may be a disadvantage;
opening the way for the intrusion of disguised emotions and
desires. In the highest experiences of the greatest mystics
the personal category appears to be transcended. “The light
in the soul which is increate,” says Eckhart, “is not satisfied
with the three Persons, in so far as each subsists in its difference ...
but it is determined to know whence this Being
comes, to penetrate into the Simple Ground, into the Silent
Desert within which never any difference has lain.” The
all-inclusive One is beyond all partial apprehensions, though
the true values which those apprehensions represent are
conserved in it. However pantheistic the mystic may be
on the one hand, however absolutist on the other, his communion
with God is always personal in this sense: that it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>communion with a living Reality, an object of love, capable
of response, which demands and receives from him a total
self-donation. This sense of a double movement, a self-giving
on the divine side answering to the self-giving on the
human side, is found in all great mysticism. It has, of course,
lent itself to emotional exaggeration, but in its pure form
seems an integral part of man’s apprehension of Reality.
Even where it conflicts with the mystic’s philosophy—as in
Hinduism and Neoplatonism—it is still present. It is curious
to note, for instance, how Plotinus, after safeguarding his
Absolute One from every qualification, excluding it from all
categories, defining it only by the icy method of negation,
suddenly breaks away into the language of ardent feeling
when he comes to describe that ecstasy in which he touched
the truth. Then he speaks of “the veritable love, the sharp
desire” which possessed him, appealing to the experience of
those fellow mystics who have “caught fire, and found
the splendour there.” These, he says, have “felt burning
within themselves the flame of love for what is there to
know—the passion of the lover resting on the bosom of
his love.”</p>

<p class='c005'>So we may say that the particular mental image which
the mystic forms of his objective, the traditional theology
he accepts, is not essential. Since it is never adequate, the
degree of its inadequacy is of secondary importance. Though
some creeds have proved more helpful to the mystic than
others, he is found fully developed in every great religion.
We cannot honestly say that there is any wide difference
between the Brahman, Sūfi, or Christian mystic at their best.
They are far more like each other than they are like the
average believer in their several creeds. What is essential
is the way the mystic feels about his Deity, and about his
own relation with it; for this adoring and all-possessing
consciousness of the rich and complete divine life over against
the self’s life, and of the possible achievement of a level of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>being, a sublimation of the self, wherein we are perfectly
united with it, may fairly be written down as a necessary
element of all mystical life. This is the common factor which
unites those apparently incompatible views of the Universe
which have been claimed at one time or another as mystical.
Their mystical quality abides wholly in the temper of the
self who adopts them. He may be a transcendentalist; but
if so, it is because his intuition of the divine is so lofty that
it cannot be expressed by means of any intellectual concept,
and he is bound to say with Ruysbroeck, “He is neither
This nor That.” He may be a unanimist; but if he is, it is
because he finds in other men—more, in the whole web of
life—that mysterious living essence which is a mode of God’s
existence, and which he loves, seeks and recognizes everywhere.
“How shall I find words for the beauty of my
Beloved? For He is merged in all beauty,” says Kabir,
“His colour is in all the pictures of the world, and it bewitches
the body and the mind.” He may be—often is—a sacramentalist;
but if so, only because the symbol or the sacrament
help him to touch God. So <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Thomas:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Adoro te devote, latens Deitas,</div>
      <div class='line'>Quæ sub his figuris vere latitas.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The moment the mystic suspects that any of these things are
obstacles instead of means, he rejects them; to the scandal
of those who habitually confuse the image with the reality.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus we get the temperamental symbolist, quietist, nature-mystic,
or transcendentalist. We get Plotinus rapt to the
“bare pure One”; <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Augustine’s impassioned communion
with Perfect Beauty; Eckhart declaring his achievement of
the “wilderness of God”; Jacopone da Todi prostrate in
adoration before the “Love that gives all things form”;
Ruysbroeck describing his achievement of “that wayless
abyss of fathomless beatitude where the Trinity of divine
persons possess their nature in the essential Unity;” Jacob
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Boehme gazing into the fire-world and there finding the
living heart of the Universe; Kabir listening to the rhythmic
music of Reality, and seeing the worlds told like beads within
the Being of God. And at the opposite pole we find Mechthild
of Madgeburg’s amorous conversations with her “heavenly
Bridegroom,” the many mystical experiences connected with
the Eucharist, the Sūfi’s enraptured description of God as
the “Matchless Chalice and the Sovereign Wine,” the narrow
intensity and emotional raptures of contemplatives of the
type of Richard Rolle. We cannot refuse the title of mystic
to any of these; because in every case their aim is union
between God and the soul. This is the one essential of
mysticism, and there are as many ways from one term to the
other as there are variations in the spirit of man. But, on
the other hand, when anybody speaking of mysticism proposes
an object that is less than God—increase of knowledge, of
health, of happiness, occultism, intercourse with spirits,
supernormal experience in general—then we may begin to
suspect that we are off the track.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now we come to the next group of essentials: the necessary
acts and dispositions of the mystic himself, the development
which takes place in him—the psychological facts, that is to
say, which are represented by the so-called “mystic way.”
The mystic way is best understood as a process of sublimation,
which carries the correspondences of the self with the Universe
up to higher levels than those on which our normal consciousness
works. Just as the normal consciousness stands over
against the unconscious, which, with its buried impulses and
its primitive and infantile cravings, represents a cruder
reaction of the organism to the external world; so does the
developed mystical life stand over against normal consciousness,
with its preoccupations and its web of illusions encouraging
the animal will-to-dominate and animal will-to-live.
Normal consciousness sorts out some elements from the mass
of experiences beating at our doors and constructs from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>them a certain order; but this order lacks any deep meaning
or true cohesion, because normal consciousness is incapable
of apprehending the underlying reality from which these
scattered experiences proceed. The claim of the mystical
consciousness is to a closer reading of truth; to an apprehension
of the divine unifying principle behind appearance.
“The One,” says Plotinus, “is present everywhere and
absent only from those unable to perceive it”; and when
we <i>do</i> perceive it we “have another life ... attaining the
aim of our existence, and our rest.” To know this at first
hand—not to guess, believe or accept, but to be certain—is
the highest achievement of human consciousness, and the
ultimate object of mysticism. How is it done?</p>

<p class='c005'>There are two ways of attacking this problem which may
conceivably help us. The first consists in a comparison of
the declarations of different mystics, and a sorting out of
those elements which they have in common: a careful watch
being kept, of course, for the results of conscious or unconscious
imitation, of tradition and of theological preconceptions.
In this way we get some first-hand evidence of factors which
are at any rate usually present, and may possibly be essential.
The second line of enquiry consists in a re-translation into
psychological terms of these mystical declarations; when
many will reveal the relation in which they stand to the
psychic life of man.</p>

<p class='c005'>Reviewing the first-hand declarations of the mystics, we
inevitably notice one prominent feature: the frequency with
which they break up their experience into three phases.
Sometimes they regard these objectively, and speak of three
worlds or three aspects of God of which they become successively
aware. Sometimes they regard them subjectively,
and speak of three stages of growth through which they
pass, such as those of Beginner, Proficient, and Perfect; or
of phases of spiritual progress in which we first meditate
upon reality, then contemplate reality, and at last are united
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>with reality. But among the most widely separated mystics
of the East and West this threefold experience can nearly
always be traced. There are, of course, obvious dangers in
attaching absolute value to number-schemes of this kind.
Numbers have an uncanny power over the human mind;
once let a symbolic character be attributed to them, and the
temptation to make them fit the facts at all costs becomes
overwhelming. We all know that the number “three” has
a long religious history, and are therefore inclined to look
with suspicion on its claim to interpret the mystic life. At
the same time there are other significant numbers—such as
“seven” and “ten”—which have never gained equal currency
as the bases of mystical formulæ. We may agree that
the mediæval mystics found the threefold division of spiritual
experience in Neoplatonism; but we must also agree that a
formula of this kind is not likely to survive for nearly 2000
years unless it agrees with the facts. Those who use it with
the greatest conviction are not theorists. They are the
practical mystics, who are intent on making maps of the
regions into which they have penetrated.</p>

<p class='c005'>Moreover, this is no mere question of handing on one
single tradition. The mystics describe their movement from
appearance to reality in many different ways, and use many
incompatible religious symbols. The one constant factor is
the discrimination of three phases of consciousness, no more,
no less, in which we can recognize certain common characteristics.
“There are,” says Philo, “three kinds of life:
life as it concerns God, life as it concerns the creature, and a
third intermediate life, a mixture of the former two.” Consistently
with this, Plotinus speaks of three descending phases
or principles of Divine Reality: the Godhead, or absolute
and unconditioned One; its manifestation as <i>Nous</i>, the Divine
Mind or Spirit which inspires the “intelligible” and eternal
world; and <i>Psyche</i>, the Life or Soul of the physical Universe.
Man, normally in correspondence with this physical world of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>succession and change, may by spiritual intuition achieve
first consciousness of the eternal world of spiritual values,
in which indeed the apex of his soul already dwells; and in
brief moments of ecstatic vision may rise above this to communion
with its source, the Absolute One. There you have
the mystic’s vision of the Universe, and the mystic’s way of
purification, enlightenment and ecstasy, bringing new and
deeper knowledge of reality as the self’s interest, urged by
its loving desire of the Ultimate, is shifted from sense to soul,
from soul to spirit. There is here no harsh dualism, no
turning from a bad material world to a good spiritual world.
We are invited to one gradual undivided process of sublimation,
penetrating ever more deeply into the reality of the
Universe, to find at last “that One who is present everywhere
and absent only from those who do not perceive Him.”
What we behold, that we are: citizens, according to our own
will and desire, of the surface world of the senses, the deeper
world of life, or the ultimate world of Spiritual reality.</p>

<p class='c005'>An almost identical doctrine appears in the Upanishads. At
the heart of reality is Brahma, “other than the known, and
above the unknown.” His manifestation is Ananda, that
spiritual world which is the true object of æsthetic passion
and religious contemplation. From its life and consciousness
are born, in it they have their being, to it they must return.
Finally, there is the world-process as we know it, which
represents Ananda taking form. So too the mystic Kabir,
who represents an opposition to the Vedantic philosophy,
says: “From beyond the Infinite the Infinite comes, and
from the Infinite the finite extends.” And again: “Some
contemplate the formless and others meditate on form, but
the wise man knows that Brahma is beyond both.” Here
we have the finite world of becoming, the infinite world of
being, and Brahma, the Unconditioned Absolute, exceeding
and including all. Yet, as Kabir distinctly declares again
and again, there are no fences between these aspects of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Universe. When we come to the root of reality we find that
“Conditioned and Unconditioned are but one word”; the
difference is in our own degree of awareness.</p>

<p class='c005'>Compare with this three of the great mediæval Catholic
mystics: that acute psychologist Richard of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Victor,
the ardent poet and contemplative Jacopone da Todi, and
the profound Ruysbroeck. Richard of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Victor says that
there are three phases in the contemplative consciousness.
The first is called dilation of mind, enlarging and deepening
our vision of the world. The next is elevation of mind, in
which we behold the realities which are above ourselves.
The third is ecstasy, in which the mind is carried up to contact
with truth in its pure simplicity. This is really the universe
of Plotinus translated into subjective terms. So, too, Jacopone
da Todi says in the symbolism of his day that three heavens
are open to man. He must climb from one to the other;
it is hard work, but love and longing press him on. First,
when the mind has achieved self-conquest, the “starry
heaven” of multiplicity is revealed to it. Its darkness
is lit by scattered lights; points of reality pierce the sky.
Next, it achieves the “crystalline heaven” of lucid contemplation,
where the soul is conformed to the rhythm of the
divine life, and by its loving intuition apprehends God under
veils. Lastly, in ecstasy it may be lifted to that ineffable
state which he calls the “hidden heaven,” where it enjoys a
vision of imageless reality and “enters into possession of all
that is God.” Ruysbroeck says that he has experienced
three orders of reality: the natural world, theatre of our
moral struggle; the essential world, where God and Eternity
are indeed known, but by intermediaries; and the super-essential
world, where without intermediary, and beyond all
separation, “above reason and without reason,” the soul is
united to “the glorious and absolute One.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Take, again, a totally different mystic, Jacob Boehme.
He says that he saw in the Divine Essence three principles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>or aspects. The first he calls “the deepest Deity, without
and beyond Nature,” and the next its manifestation in the
Eternal Light-world. The third is that outer world in which
we dwell according to the body, which is a manifestation,
image or similitude of the Eternal. “And we are thus,” he
says, “to understand reality as a threefold being, or three
worlds <i>in one another</i>.” We observe again the absence of
water-tight compartments. The whole of reality is present
in every part of it; and the power of correspondence with
all these aspects of it is latent in man. “If one sees a right
man,” says Boehme again, “he may say, I see here three
worlds standing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>We have now to distinguish the essential element in all
this. How does it correspond with psychological facts?
Some mystics, like Richard of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Victor, have frankly exhibited
its subjective side and so helped us to translate the statements
of their fellows. Thus Dionysius the Areopagite says in a
celebrated passage: “Threefold is the way to God. The
first is the way of purification, in which the mind is inclined
to learn true wisdom. The second is the way of illumination,
in which the mind by contemplation is kindled to the burning
of love. The third is the way of union, in which the mind
by understanding, reason and spirit is led up by God alone.”
This formula restates the Plotinian law; for the “contemplation”
of Dionysius is the “spiritual intuition” of Plotinus,
which inducts man into the intelligible world; his “union”
is the Plotinian ecstatic vision of the One. It profoundly
impressed the later Christian mystics, and has long been
accepted as the classic description of spiritual growth, because
it has been found again and again to answer to experience.
It is therefore worth our while to examine it with some care.</p>

<p class='c005'>First we notice how gentle, gradual and natural is the
process of sublimation that Dionysius demands of us. According
to him, the mystic life is a life centred on reality: the
life that first seeks reality without flinching, then loves and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>adores the reality perceived, and at last, wholly surrendered
to it, is “led by God alone.” First, the self is “inclined to
learn <i>true</i> wisdom.” It awakes to new needs, is cured of its
belief in sham values, and distinguishes between real and
unreal objects of desire. That craving for more life and
more love which lies at the very heart of our selfhood, here
slips from the charmed circle of the senses into a wider air.
When this happens abruptly it is called “conversion”; and
may then have the character of a psychic convulsion and be
accompanied by various secondary psychological phenomena.
But often it comes without observation. Here the essentials
are a desire and a disillusionment sufficiently strong to overcome
our natural sloth, our primitive horror of change. “The
first beginning of all things is a craving,” says Boehme; “we
are creatures of will and desire.” The divine discontent,
the hunger for reality, the unwillingness to be satisfied with
the purely animal or the purely social level of consciousness,
is the first essential stage in the development of the mystical
consciousness.</p>

<p class='c005'>So the self is either suddenly or gradually inclined to “true
wisdom”; and this change of angle affects the whole character,
not only or indeed specially the intellectual outlook,
but the ethical outlook too. This is the meaning of “purgation.”
False ways of feeling and thinking, established
complexes which have acquired for us an almost sacred
character, and governed though we knew it not all our reactions
to life—these must be broken up. That mental and moral
sloth which keeps us so comfortably wrapped in unrealities
must go. This phase in the mystic’s growth has been specially
emphasized and worked out by the Christian mystics, who
have made considerable additions to the philosophy and
natural history of the soul. The Christian sense of sin and
conception of charity, the Christian notion of humility as a
finding of our true level, an exchanging of the unreal standards
of egoism for the disconcerting realities of life seen from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>angle of Eternity; the steadfast refusal to tolerate any claim
to spirituality which is not solidly based on moral values,
or which is divorced from the spirit of tenderness and love—all
this has immensely enriched the mysticism of the West,
and filled up some of the gaps left by Neoplatonism. It is
characteristic of Christianity that, addressing itself to all
men—not, as Neoplatonism tended to do, to the superior
person—and offering to all men participation in Eternal Life,
it takes human nature as it is; and works from the bottom
up, instead of beginning at a level which only a few of the
race attain. Christianity perceived how deeply normal men
are enslaved by the unconscious; how great a moral struggle
is needed for their emancipation. Hence it concentrated on
the first stage of purgation, and gave it new meaning and
depth. The monastic rule of poverty, chastity and obedience—and
we must remember that the original aim of monasticism
was to provide a setting in which the mystical life
could be lived—aims at the removal of those self-centred
desires and attachments which chain consciousness to a
personal instead of a universal life. He who no longer craves
for personal possessions, pleasures or powers, is very near to
perfect liberty. His attention is freed from its usual concentration
on the self’s immediate interests, and at once he
sees the Universe in a new, more valid, because disinterested
light.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Povertate è nulla avere</div>
      <div class='line'>e nulla cosa poi volere</div>
      <div class='line'>ed omne cosa possedere</div>
      <div class='line'>en spirito de libertade.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Yet this positive moral purity which Christians declared
necessary to the spiritual life was not centred on a lofty
aloofness from human failings, but on a self-giving and
disinterested love, the complete abolition of egoism. This
alone, it declared, could get rid of that inward disharmony—one
aspect of the universal conflict between the instinctive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>and the rational life—which Boehme called the “powerful
contrarium” warring with the soul.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now this “perfect charity in life surrendered,” however
attained, is an essential character of the true mystic; without
it, contemplation is an impossibility or a sham. But when
we come to the means by which it is to be attained, we re-enter
the region of controversy; for here we are at once
confronted by the problem of asceticism, and its connection
with mysticism—perhaps the largest and most difficult of
the questions now facing those who are concerned with the
re-statement of the laws of the spiritual life. Originally
regarded as a gymnastic of the soul, an education in those
manly virtues of self-denial and endurance without which the
spiritual life is merely an exquisite form of hedonism,
asceticism was identified by Christian thought with the
idea of mortification; the killing out of all those impulses
which deflect the soul from the straight path to God. For
the true mystic, it is never more than a means to an end;
and is often thrown aside when that end is attained. Its
necessity is therefore a purely practical question. Fasting
and watching may help one to dominate unruly instincts, and
so attain a sharper and purer concentration on God; but
make another so hungry and sleepy that he can think of
nothing else. Thus Jacopone da Todi said of his own early
austerities that they resulted chiefly in indigestion, insomnia
and colds in the head; whilst John Wesley found in fasting
a positive spiritual good. Some ascetic practices again are
almost certainly disguised indulgences of those very cravings
which they are supposed to kill, but in fact merely repress.
Others—such as hair shirts, chains, and so forth—depended
for their meaning on a mediæval view of the body and of
the virtues of physical pain which is practically extinct, and
now seems to most of us utterly artificial. No one will deny
that austerity is better than luxury for the spiritual life;
but perfect detachment of the will and senses can be achieved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>without resort to merely physical expedients by those living
normally in the world, and this is the essential thing.</p>

<p class='c005'>The true asceticism is a gymnastic not of the body, but
of the mind. It involves training in the art of recollection;
the concentration of thought, will, and love upon the eternal
realities which we commonly ignore. The embryo contemplative,
if his spiritual vision is indeed to be enlarged, and
his mind kindled, as Dionysius says, to “the burning of
love,” must acquire and keep a special state of inward poise,
an attitude of attention, which is best described as “the state
of prayer”; that same condition which George Fox called
“keeping in the Universal Spirit.” If we do not attend to
reality, we are not likely to perceive it. The readjustments
which shall make this attention natural and habitual are a
phase in man’s inward conflict for the redemption of consciousness
from its lower and partial attachments. This
conflict is no dream. It means hard work; mental and
moral discipline of the sternest kind. The downward drag
is incessant, and can be combated only by those who are
clearly aware of it, and are willing to sacrifice lower interests
and joys to the demands of the spiritual life. In this sense
mortification is an integral part of the “purgative way.”
Unless the self’s “inclination to true wisdom” is strong
enough to inspire these costing and heroic efforts, its spiritual
cravings do not deserve the name of mysticism.</p>

<p class='c005'>These, then, seem essential factors in the readjustment
which the mystics call purgation. We go on to their next
stage, the so-called “way of illumination.” Here, says
Dionysius, the mind is kindled by contemplation to the
burning of love. There is a mental and an emotional enhancement,
whereby the self apprehends the reality it has sought;
whether under the veils of religion, philosophy, or nature-mysticism.
Many mystics have made clear statements about
this phase in human transcendence. Thus the Upanishads
invite us to “know everything in the Universe as enveloped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>in God.” “When the purified seeker,” says Plato, “comes
to the end, he will suddenly perceive a nature of wondrous
beauty.... Beauty absolute, separate, simple and everlasting.”
His follower Plotinus says that by spiritual intuition
man, “wrought into harmony with the Supreme,” enters
into communion with <i>Nous</i>, the “intelligible world” of
eternal realities—that splendour yonder which is his home:
and further that this light, shining upon the soul, enlightens
it, makes it a member of the spiritual order, and so “transforms
the furnace of this world into a garden of flowers.”
Ruysbroeck declares that this eternal world “is not God,
but it is the light in which we see Him.” Jacopone da Todi
says that the self, achieving the crystalline heaven, “feels
itself to be a part of all things,” because it has annihilated
its separate will and is conformed to the movement of the
Divine Life. Kabir says: “The middle region of the sky,
wherein the Spirit dwelleth, is radiant with the music of
light.” Boehme calls it the “light-world proceeding from
the fire-world”; and says it is the origin of that outward
world in which we dwell. “This light,” he says, “shines
through and through all, but is only apprehended by that
which unites itself thereto.” It seems to me fairly clear
that these, and many other descriptions I cannot now quote,
refer to an identical state of consciousness, which might be
called an experience of Eternity, but not of the Eternal One.
I say “an experience,” not merely a mental perception.
Contemplation, which is the traditional name for that concentrated
attention in which this phase of reality is revealed,
is an activity of all our powers: the heart, the will, the mind.
Dionysius emphasizes the ardent love which this revelation
of reality calls forth, and which is indeed a condition of our
apprehension of it; for the cold gaze of the metaphysician
cannot attain it, unless he be a lover and a mystic too. “By
love He may be gotten and holden, by thought never,” says
the author of <i>The Cloud of Unknowing</i>. It is only through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>the mood of humble and loving receptivity in which the artist
perceives beauty, that the human spirit can apprehend a
reality which is greater than itself. The many declarations
about noughting, poverty and “holy nothingness” refer to
this. The meek and poor of spirit really are the inheritors
of Eternity.</p>

<p class='c005'>So we may place the attitude of selfless adoration, the
single-hearted passion of the soul, among the essentials of
the mystic in the illuminated way. A very wide range of
mystical experiences must be attributed to this second stage
in man’s spiritual growth. Some at least of its secrets are
known to all who are capable of æsthetic passion; who, in
the presence of beauty, know themselves to stand upon the
fringe of another plane of being, where the elements of common
life are given new colour and value, and its apparent disharmonies
are resolved. So, too, that deep sense of a divine
companionship which many ardent souls achieve in prayer is
a true if transitory experience of illumination. We shall
probably be right in assuming that the enormous majority
of mystics never get beyond this level of consciousness.
Certainly a large number of religious writers on mysticism
attribute to its higher and more personal manifestations the
names of “divine union” and “unitive life”; thereby
adding to the difficulty of classifying spiritual states, and
showing themselves unaware of the great distinction which
such full-grown mystics as Plotinus, Jacopone da Todi or
Ruysbroeck describe as existing between this “middle
heaven” and the ecstatic vision of the One which alone
really satisfies their thirst for truth. Thus Jacopone at first
uses the strongest unitive language to describe that rapturous
and emotional intercourse with Divine Love which characterized
his middle period; but when he at last achieves the
vision of the Absolute, he confesses that he was in error in
supposing that it was indeed the Truth Whom he thus saw
and worshipped under veils.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>“Or, parme, fo fallanza,</div>
      <div class='line'>non se’ quel che credea,</div>
      <div class='line'>tenendo non avea</div>
      <div class='line'>vertá senza errore.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Thus Ruysbroeck attributes to the contemplative life, “the
inward and upward-going ways by which one may pass into
the Presence of God,” but distinguishes these from that super-essential
life wherein “we are swallowed up, beyond reason
and above reason, in the deep quiet of the Godhead which is
never moved.”</p>

<p class='c005'>All the personal raptures of devotional mysticism, all the
nature-mystic’s joyous consciousness of God in creation,
Blake’s “world of imagination and vision,” the “coloured
land” of Æ., the Sūfi’s “tavern on the way,” where he is
refreshed by a draught of supersensual wine, belong to the
way of illumination. For the Christian mystic the world
into which it inducts him is, pre-eminently, the sphere of the
divine Logos-Christ, fount of creation and source of all beauty;
the hidden Steersman who guides and upholds the phenomenal
world:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Splendor che dona a tutto ’l mondo luce,</div>
      <div class='line'>amor, Iesú, de li angeli belleza,</div>
      <div class='line'>cielo e terra per te si conduce</div>
      <div class='line'>e splende in tutte cose tua fattezza.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Here the reality behind appearance is still mediated to
the mystic under symbols and forms. The variation of these
symbols is great; his adoring gaze now finds new life and
significance in the appearances of nature, the creations of
music and of art, the imagery of religion and philosophy, and
reality speaks to him through his own credal conceptions.
But absolute value cannot be attributed to any of these,
even the most sacred: they change, yet the experience
remains. Thus an identical consciousness of close communion
with God is obtained by the non-sacramental Quaker in his
silence and by the sacramental Catholic in the Eucharist.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>The Christian contemplative’s sense of personal intercourse
with the divine as manifest in the incarnate Christ is
hard to distinguish from that of the Hindu Vaishnavite,
when we have allowed for the different constituents of his
apperceiving mass:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Dark, dark the far Unknown and closed the way</div>
      <div class='line'>To thought and speech; silent the Scriptures; yea,</div>
      <div class='line'>No word the Vedas say.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Not thus the Manifest. How fair! how near!</div>
      <div class='line'>Gone is our thirst if only He appear—</div>
      <div class='line'>He, to the heart so dear.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>So, too, the Sūfi mystic who has learned to say: “I never
saw anything without seeing God therein;” Kabir exclaiming:
“I have stilled my restless mind, and my heart is radiant;
for in Thatness I have seen beyond Thatness, in company I
have seen the Comrade Himself;” the Neoplatonist rapt in
contemplation of the intelligible world “yonder”; Brother
Lawrence doing his cooking in the presence of God, reveal
under analysis an identical type of consciousness. This
consciousness is the essential; the symbols under which the
self apprehends it are not.</p>

<p class='c005'>Among these symbols we must reckon a large number of
the secondary phenomena of mysticism: divine visions and
voices, and other dramatizations of the self’s apprehensions
and desires. The best mystics have always recognized the
doubtful nature of these so-called divine revelations and
favours, and have tried again and again to set up tests for
discerning those which really “come from God”—<i>i. e.</i>
mediate a valid spiritual experience. Personally, I think very
few of these phenomena are mystical in the true sense. Just
as our normal consciousness is more or less at the mercy of
invasions from the unconscious region, of impulses which we
fail to trace to their true origin; so too the mystical consciousness
is perpetually open to invasion from the lower
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>centres. These invasions are not always understood by the
mystic. Obvious examples are the erotic raptures of the
Sūfi poets, and the emotional, even amorous relations in which
many Christian ascetics believe themselves to stand to Christ
or Our Lady. The Holy Ghost saying to Angela of Foligno,
“I love you better than any other woman in the vale of
Spoleto”; the human raptures of Mechthild of Magdeburg
with her Bridegroom; <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Bernard’s attitude to the Virgin;
the passionate love-songs of Jacopone da Todi; the mystical
marriage of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Catherine of Siena; <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Teresa’s “wound of
love”; these, and many similar episodes, demand no supernatural
explanation, and add nothing to our knowledge of the
work of the Spirit in man’s soul. So, too, the infantile craving
for a sheltering and protective love finds expression over and
over again in mystical literature, and satisfaction in the states
of consciousness which it has induced. The innate longing
of the self for more life, more love, an ever greater and fuller
experience, attains a complete realization in the lofty mystical
state called union with God. But failing this full achievement,
the self is capable of offering itself many disguised
satisfactions; and among these disguised satisfactions we
must reckon at least the majority of “divine favours”
enjoyed by contemplatives of an emotional type. Whatever
the essence of mysticism may turn out to be, it is well to
recognize these lapses to lower levels as among the least
fortunate of its accidents.</p>

<p class='c005'>We come to the third stage, the true goal of mystic experience;
the intuitive contact with that ultimate reality which
theologians mean by the Godhead and philosophers by the
Absolute, a contact in which, as Richard of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Victor says
“the soul gazes upon Truth without any veils of creatures—not
in a mirror darkly, but in its pure simplicity.” The
claim to this is the loftiest claim which can be made by human
consciousness. There is little we can say of it, because there
is little we know; save that the vision or experience is always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>the vision or experience of a Unity which reconciles all opposites,
and fulfils all man’s highest intuitions of reality. “Be
lost altogether in Brahma like an arrow that has completely
penetrated its target,” say the Upanishads. This self-loss,
says Dionysius the Areopagite, is the Divine Initiation:
wherein we “pass beyond the topmost altitudes of the holy
ascent, and leave behind all divine illumination and voices
and heavenly utterances; and plunge into the darkness where
truly dwells, as Scripture saith, that One Which is beyond all
things.” Some recent theologians have tried to separate
the conceptions of God and of the Absolute: but mystics
never do this, though some of the most clear-sighted, such as
Meister Eckhart, have separated that unconditioned Godhead
known in ecstasy from the personal God who is the object
of devotional religion, and who represents a humanization
of reality. When the great mystic achieves the “still,
glorious, and absolute Oneness” which finally satisfies his
thirst for truth—the “point where all lines meet and show
their meaning”—he generally confesses how symbolic was
the object of his earlier devotion, how partial his supposed
communion with the Divine. Thus Jacopone da Todi—exact
and orthodox Catholic though he was—when he reached
“the hidden heaven,” discovered and boldly declared the
approximate character of all his previous conceptions of, and
communion with God; the great extent to which subjective
elements had entered into his experience. In the great ode
which celebrates his ecstatic vision of Truth, when “ineffable
love, imageless goodness, measureless light” at last shone in
his heart, he says: “I thought I knew Thee, tasted Thee,
saw Thee under image: believing I held Thee in Thy completeness
I was filled with delight and unmeasured love. But
<i>now</i> I see I was mistaken—Thou art not as I thought and
firmly held.” So Tauler says that compared with the warm
colour and multiplicity of devotional experience, the very
Godhead is a “rich nought,” a “bare pure ground”; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Ruysbroeck that it is “an unwalled world,” “neither this
nor that.” “This fruition of God,” he says again, “is a still
and glorious and essential Oneness beyond the differentiation
of the Persons, where there is neither an outpouring nor an
indrawing of God, but the Persons are still and one in fruitful
love, in calm and glorious unity.... There is God our
fruition and His own, in an eternal and fathomless
bliss.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“How, then, am I to love the Godhead?” says Eckhart.
“Thou shalt love Him as He is: not as a God, not as a Spirit,
not as a Person, not as an image, but as a sheer pure One.
And in this One we are to sink from nothing to nothing, so
help us God.” “This consciousness of the One,” says Plotinus,
“comes not by knowledge, but by an actual Presence superior
to any knowing. To have it, the soul must rise above knowledge,
above all its wandering from its unity.” He goes on
to explain that all partial objects of love and contemplation,
even Beauty and Goodness themselves, are lower than this,
springing from the One as light from the sun. To see the
disc, we must put on smoked glasses, shut off the rays, and
submit to the “radiant darkness” which enters so frequently
into mystical descriptions of the Absolute.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is an interesting question whether this consummation
of the mystic way need involve that suppression of the surface-consciousness
which is called ecstasy. The majority of mystics
think that it must; and probably it is almost inevitable that
so great a concentration and so lofty an intuition should
for the time it lasts drive all other forms of awareness from
the field. Even simple contemplation cannot be achieved
without some deliberate stilling of the senses, a deliberate
focusing of our vagrant attention, and abolishes self-consciousness
while it lasts. This is the way that our mental
machinery works; but this should not make us regard trance-states
as any part of the essence of mysticism. The ecstatic
condition is no guarantee of mystic vision. It is frequently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>pathological, and is often found along with other abnormal
conditions in emotional visionaries whose revelations have no
ultimate characteristics. It is, however, just as uncritical to
assume that ecstasy is necessarily a pathological symptom,
as it is to assume that it is necessarily a mystic state. We
have a test which we can apply to the ecstatic; and which
separates the results of nervous disorder from those of spiritual
transcendence. “What fruit dost thou bring back from
this thy vision?” is the final question which Jacopone da
Todi addresses to the mystic’s soul. And the answer is:
“An ordered life in every state.” The true mystic in his
ecstasy has seen, however obscurely, the key of the Universe:
“la forma universal di questo nodo.” Hence he has a clue
by which to live. Reality has become real to him; and
there are no others of whom we can fully say that. So,
ordered correspondence with each level of existence, physical
and spiritual, successive and eternal—a practical realization
of the proportions of life—is the guarantee of the genuine
character of that sublimation of consciousness which is called
the mystic way; and this distinguishes it from the fantasies
of psychic illness or the disguised self-indulgences of the
dream-world. The real mystic is not a selfish visionary. He
grows in vigour as he draws nearer and nearer the sources
of true life, and his goal is only reached when he participates
in the creative energies of the Divine Nature. The perfect
man, says the Sūfi, must not only die into God in ecstasy
(<i>fana</i>), but abide in and with Him (<i>baqa</i>), manifesting His
truth in the world of time. He is called to a life more active,
because more contemplative, than that of other men: to
fulfil the monastic ideal of a balanced career of work and
prayer. “Then only is our life a <i>whole</i>,” says Ruysbroeck,
“when contemplation and work dwell in us side by side, and
we are perfectly in both of them at once.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Plotinus speaks in the same sense under another image
in one of his most celebrated passages: “We always move
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>round the One, but we do not always fix our gaze upon It.
We are like a choir of singers standing round the conductor,
who do not always sing in time, because their attention is
diverted to some external object. When they look at the
conductor, they sing well and are really with him. So we
always move round the One. If we did not, we should
dissolve and cease to exist. But we do not always look
towards the One. When we do, we attain the end of our
existence and our rest; and we no longer sing out of tune,
but form in truth a divine choir about the One.” In this
conception of man’s privilege and duty we have the indestructible
essence of mysticism.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>
  <h2 id='chap02' class='c004'>THE MYSTIC AND THE CORPORATE LIFE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'>One of the commonest of the criticisms which are brought
against the mystics is that they represent an unsocial type
of religion; that their spiritual enthusiasms are personal
and individual, and that they do not share or value the
corporate life and institutions of the church or community
to which they belong. Yet, as a matter of fact, the relation
that does and should exist between personal religion and the
corporate life of the church frequently appears in them in a
peculiarly intense, a peculiarly interesting form; and in their
lives, perhaps, more easily than elsewhere, we may discern
the principles which do or should govern the relation of the
individual to the community.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the true mystic, who is so often and so wrongly called
a “religious individualist,” we see personal religion raised
to its highest power. If we accept his experience as genuine,
it involves an intercourse with the spiritual world, an awareness
of it, which transcends the normal experience, and
appears to be independent of the general religious consciousness
of the community to which he belongs. The mystic
speaks with God as a person with a Person, and not as a
member of a group. He lives by an immediate knowledge
far more than by belief; by a knowledge achieved in those
hours of direct, unmediated intercourse with the Transcendent
when, as he says, he was “in union with God.” The certitude
then gained—a certitude which he cannot impart, and
which is not generally diffused—governs all his reactions
to the Universe. It even persists and upholds him in those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>terrible hours of darkness when all his sense of spiritual reality
is taken away.</p>

<p class='c005'>Such a personality as this seems at first sight to stand in
little need of the support which the smaller nature, the more
languid religious consciousness, receives from the corporate
spirit. By the very term “mystic” we indicate a certain
aloofness from the crowd, suggest that he is in possession of
a secret which the community as a whole does not and cannot
share; that he lives at levels to which they cannot rise. I
think that much of the distrust with which he is often regarded
comes from this sense of his independence of the herd; his
apparent separation from the often clumsy and always
symbolic methods of institutional religion, and the further
fact that his own methods and results cannot be criticized
or checked by those who have not shared them. “I spake
as I saw,” said David; and those who did not see can only
preserve a respectful or an exasperated silence.</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet this common opinion that the mystic is a lonely soul
wholly absorbed in his vertical relation with God, that his
form of religious life represents an opposition to, and an
implicit criticism of, the corporate and institutional form of
religious life; this is decisively contradicted by history; which
shows us, again and again, the great mystics as the loyal
children of the great religious institutions, and forces us to
admit that here as in other departments of human activity
the corporate and the individual life are intimately plaited
together. Even those who have broken away from the
churches that reared them, have quickly drawn to themselves
disciples, and become the centres of new groups. Surely,
therefore, it is worth while to examine, if we can, the nature
of the connection between these two factors: to ask, on the
one hand, what it is that the corporate life and the group-consciousness
which it develops give the mystic; on the
other, what is the real value of the mystic to the corporate
life of his church?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>As to the first question: What is it that the corporate
life does for the great spiritual genius?—for I think that we
may allow the great mystic to be that. First, and most
obviously, it gives him a favourable environment. He must
have an environment: he must be affected by it. That is a
certainty in the case of any living thing; a certainty so
obvious that it would hardly be worth stating were it not
that those who talk about the mystic craving for solitude—his
complete aloofness from human life—seem often to ignore
it. The idea of solitude in any complete sense is, of course,
an illusion. We are bound, if we live at all, to accept the
fact of a living world outside ourselves, to have social relations
with something; and it only remains to decide what these
relations shall be. The <i>yogi</i> or the hermit who retreats to
the forest in order to concentrate his mind more utterly
upon the quest of God, only exchanges the society of human
beings for the society of other living things. Did he eliminate
all else, the parasites of his own body, the bacterial populations
of his alimentary system, would be there to remind him
that man cannot live alone. He may shift his position in
the web of life, but its strands will enmesh him still. So,
too, the monk or nun “buried alive” in the cloister is still
living a family life; only it is a family life that is governed
by special ideals.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now it is plainly better for the mystic, whose aim is the
establishment of special relations with the spiritual order,
that the social consciousness in which he is immersed, and
from which he is taking colour all the time, should have a
spiritual and religious tendency; that the social acts in
which he takes part should harmonize rather than conflict
with his own deep intuition of reality. The difference in
degree between that deep intuition and the outward corporate
acts—the cult—which he thus shares, may be enormous:
for the cult is an expression of the crowd consciousness, and
manifests its spiritual crudity, its innate conservatism, its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>primitive demands for safety and personal rewards. The
inadequacy or unreality of the forms, the low level of the
adoration which they evoke, may distress and even disgust
him. Yet, even so, it is better for him that he should be
within a church than outside it. Compared with this one
fact—that he is a member of a social group which recognizes
spiritual values, and therefore lives in an environment permeated
by religious concepts—the accuracy in detail of the
creed which that group professes, the adequacy of its liturgical
acts, is unimportant.</p>

<p class='c005'>Next, the demands made and restrictions imposed by the
community on the individual are good for the mystic. Man
is social right through; in spirit as well as in body and mind.
His most sublime spiritual experiences are themselves social
in type. Intercourse of a person with a Person, the merging
of his narrow consciousness in a larger consciousness, the
achievement of a divine sonship, a spiritual marriage: these
are the highest things that he can say concerning his achievement
of Divine Reality. And they all entail, not a narrow
self-realization, but the breaking-down of barriers; the
setting-up of wider relationships. It follows that self-mergence
in the common life is an education for that self-mergence in
the absolute life at which the mystic aims. Such self-mergence,
and the training in humility, self-denial, obedience,
suppleness, which is involved in it, is held by all ascetic
teachers to be essential to the education of the human soul.
Union with, and to a certain extent submission to, the church,
to the family—to life, in fact—an attitude of self-giving
surrender: this is the best of preparations for that total
self-naughting of the soul which is involved in union with
God; that utter doing-away of the I, the Me, and the Mine,
till it becomes one will and one love with the divine will and
love.</p>

<p class='c005'>On these two counts alone—harmonious environment and
salutary discipline—we shall expect, other things being equal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>that the richest and most fruitful types of mystical experience
will arise within religious institutions rather than outside
them; and as a matter of fact this is what we do find. The
Hindu ascetic has his recognized place in the Hindu system.
He has but reached the summit of a pyramid which is firmly
based on earth. The Sūfi is a good Moslem, and commonly
the member of a religious confraternity which imposes a
strict rule of life. The Christian mystic, too, grows up from
the Christian society. His roots strike deep down into that
favouring soil. Though his branches may shoot up to the
heavens, and seem to draw thence all the light and heat by
which he lives, yet he is really fed from below as well as from
above. When he refuses to acknowledge this principle,
when he abjures the discipline, the authority, the support of
the corporate life, and regards himself as a separate individual,
dependent on direct inspiration alone; how quickly he
becomes unbalanced and eccentric, how difficult it is for him
to avoid the disease of spiritual megalomania. Refusing the
support and discipline of organized religion, he becomes like
a poet who refuses to be controlled by the laws of prosody;
which seem to limit, but really strengthen and beautify, his
work.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is true that right through the history of Christian mysticism
there has been a line of insurgent mystics who have
made this refusal; whose direct vision of spiritual perfection
has brought with it so overwhelming a sense of the imperfection,
formalism, unreality, the dreadfulness of religious
institutions, that it has forced them into a position of more
or less acute revolt from the official church. So clear has
been their own consciousness of the spiritual world that the
soul’s life and growth, its actual and individual rebirth,
have shone out for them as the only things that matter. Hence
the dramatization of these things in ceremonial religion, the
effort to give spiritual values a concrete form, has seemed to
them like a blasphemous parody. Unable to harmonize the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>inward and the outward—the all-penetrating reality of
religion as they understand it, with its crude outward expression
in the external cult, where formal acts and intellectual
assents so often seem to take the place of inward changes—in
the end they solve the problem by repudiating the external
and visible church. This rebel-type, victims of exaggerated
individualism, which would make the special experiences of
a few the standard for the whole race, has persisted side by
side with the law-abiding type; who have preserved, if not
always a perfect balance between liberty and obedience, at
any rate a more reasonable proportion between them. Often
the corruption of the times in which he lived has seemed to
the mystic to make such rebellion inevitable. This is particularly
true in the case of George Fox, whose ragings were
directed far less against organized religion than against
unreal religion; and who might, had he lived in fourteenth-century
Germany, have found a congenial career as one of
the Friends of God. Yet, even so, the careers of these rebels
have been on the whole unfruitful, compared with those who
remained within the institutional framework and effected
their reforms from inside. They seldom quite escape the
taint of arrogance. There is apt to be a touch of self-consciousness
in their sanctity. We have only to compare the
influence exerted by the outstanding figures of the two groups,
to realize which type of spiritual life has had the best and
most enduring influence on the spiritual history of the race;
which, in fact, best stands the pragmatic test.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the rebel side we have, of course, the leaders of many
dead heresies and sects. The Montanists of the second
century, with their claim to direct inspiration, their cult of
ecstatic phenomena and prophetic speech; the numerous
mystical heretics and illuminati of the Middle Ages, often
preaching the most extravagant doctrines and always claiming
for them divine authority—for instance, the Brethren of the
Free Spirit, who claimed the possession of the Holy Ghost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>as an excuse not only for theological, but also for moral
aberrations. Later, there are the Quietists, a particularly
poisonous brand of unbalanced contemplatives; and, contemporary
with their revolt against Catholic forms and
authorities, innumerable mystical revolts against Protestant
forms and authorities, the very names of whose originators
are now almost forgotten. Amongst these two mighty
figures stand up: Jacob Boehme and George Fox. But we
must remember as regards Boehme that, although he certainly
spoke with great violence against the error of confusing
external acceptance of religion with internal adherence to
God, “historical Christians” with “new men,” he never
disowned the Lutheran Church within which he was born.
On the contrary, it was that church which persecuted and
finally disowned him. As to that great and strange genius,
George Fox, who aimed at nothing less than a world religion
of a mystical type, the free and conscious contact of every
soul with the Spirit of God, I believe that any unbiassed
student of his Journal must allow that, enormous as his
achievement was, it might have been far greater had his
violent sense of vocation, his remarkable spiritual gifts, been
disciplined and controlled by the corporate consciousness as
expressed in institutional religion. Then some of the energy
which he expended in denunciations of steeple-houses might
have been employed in healing the disharmony between the
visible and invisible church; helping that vision of the Eternal
by which he was possessed to find concrete expression within
traditional forms. Here, as elsewhere, the Inner Light
would have burned with a better and a truer flame had it
submitted to the limitations of a lamp.</p>

<p class='c005'>I do not suggest that these people, even the most extravagant
of them, were not truly spiritual or truly mystical.
The sort of criticism which divides mystics into two groups—the
orthodox, who are inspired by God, and the heretical,
who are inspired by Satan—of course belongs to the dark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>ages of theology. On the contrary, these rebel-mystics most
often possessed—sometimes in a highly developed form—the
sharp direct consciousness of the Divine Life which is the
essential quality of the mystic. This was to them the central
fact; by comparison with it they judged all other things.
What they did <i>not</i> possess was the balancing, equivalent
consciousness of, and reverence for, corporate human life;
that group-personality which is the church, and its value
and authority. They lacked the sense that the whole organism,
the whole herd, with all its imperfections, is yet
interdependent, and has got to move together, urged from
within by its more vivid spirits, not stung from without, as
if by some enthusiastic spiritual mosquito. To a greater
or lesser extent they failed in effect because they tried to
be mystical in a non-human instead of a human way; were
“other-worldly” in the bad sense of the word. They have
not always remembered that Christ Himself, the supreme
pattern of all mystics, lived a balanced life of clear personal
vision, unmediated intercourse with God on the one hand,
and gentle and patient submission to the corporate consciousness
on the other hand. Though severely critical of the
unrealities and hypocrisy of current institutionalism, he yet
sought to form the group, the “little flock,” in which His
ideas should be incorporated within, and not over against,
the official Jewish Church; and thus gradually to leaven
the whole.</p>

<p class='c005'>Put now against these vigorous individualists the names of
the mystics who have never felt that their passionate correspondences
with the Eternal Order—their clear vision of the
adorable Perfection of God and the imperfection, languor,
and corruption of man—need involve a break with the corporate
religious life. Observe how these have continued for
centuries to be fruitful personalities, often not merely within
their own communion, but outside it too; how they have
acted as salt, as leaven, permeating and transmuting the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>general consciousness of the Body of Christ. Often these,
too, have been reformers—drastic, unrelenting disturbers of
the established order of things. <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Bernard, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Hildegarde,
Mechthild, Jacopone da Todi, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Catherine of Siena, Tauler,
were passionate in their denunciations of slackness, corruption,
and disorder. But they made their protests, and
brought back the general consciousness to a closer contact
with reality, from within, and not from without, the Christian
church. Consider <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Bernard and Richard of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Victor,
whose writings influenced for centuries the whole of the
religious literature of Europe; <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Hildegarde, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Gertrude,
Mechthild of Magdeburg, great mystics, good churchwomen,
but severe denouncers of formalism and unreality; <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Francis of Assisi, who removed evangelical poverty from the
sphere of notion to the sphere of fact; <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Catherine of Siena,
who changed Italian politics; <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Joan of Arc, who altered
European history; the soaring transcendentalism of Ruysbroeck,
who was yet content to be a humble parish priest;
the great mystical movement of the Friends of God, ardent
Catholics and ardent reformers too. Even our own great
mystical poets, Donne, Crashaw, Vaughan, Herbert, Traherne,
Coventry Patmore and Francis Thompson, were one
and all convinced institutionalists. Finally, look at some
of the great cloistered mystics, of whom <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Teresa and <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
John of the Cross are types; and see how, though they seem
in the eyes of the world to be “buried alive,” they are and
remain the ardent centres of a spreading light, which perpetually
stimulates and revivifies not only members of their
own order or communion, but spiritually sensitive souls
outside.</p>

<p class='c005'>Perhaps it is in those contemplatives who lived within
and were obedient to the rule of the great monastic orders,
that we can see most easily the nature of the link between the
individual soul and the religious group within which it does
or should develop; the enormous value to it of tradition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>that huge accumulation of tendencies, ideals, systems, wisdom
both speculative and practical, which is preserved in the
corporate consciousness. Here the influence of the religious
family, the rule of life, the ideal held out, the severe education
in self-control administered to every novice, can always be
traced; conditioning, and, I believe, helping and bracing
the character of that communion with the Transcendent
which the individual mystic enjoys. As the baby at birth
enters into a civilization prepared for him, and is at once
supported, educated, even clothed by a tradition prepared
by countless generations of the past; so the novice, whose
spiritual childhood begins within a great monastic family,
receives—supposing, of course, that the order is true to its
ideals—the support and benefits of a tradition evolved during
previous generations in response to the needs of other similar
souls; and he is by so much the better off than he would
be were he a solitary, or a deliberate rebel who refuses to
accept the heritage of the past. He finds a life beautifully
adjusted to his needs; yet which, being greater and older
than his own, keeps his rampant individualism in check,
nurtures and cultivates his growing spiritual consciousness,
and opposes—by its perpetual demands on humility, obedience,
and unselfishness—the vice of pride which the mystical individualist
seldom escapes. Such a mystical consciousness would
not necessarily die without the support of this corporate
tradition, any more than the baby would necessarily die did it
emerge into the conditions of the paleolithic cave instead of into
those of the modern nursery. But in both cases the environment
would be unfavourable, and the effort required to attain
that position into which the child of tradition enters at
birth would be an enormous drain upon the powers of the
organism.</p>

<p class='c005'>The instinct of many mystics for a certain measure of
solitude is no contradiction of this. The hermits and the
anchorites, even such rare and extreme types as <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Anthony
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>of Egypt, who is said to have lived in perfect solitude for
twenty years, did not withdraw from the Christian society;
nor did they disown the validity of its external and institutional
life. They sought to construct or find within the
Christian church an environment within which their special
tendencies could develop in a normal way; and this not
merely for themselves, but also for the sake of other souls.
Such a period of withdrawal was felt by them to be a necessary
condition of their full effectiveness for life. So, too, the poet
or the artist must retreat from his fellows if he is to commune
with the eternal loveliness and interpret her to other men:
for a total concentration upon reality is the condition under
which it is revealed. The Catholic Church has always recognized,
and does still in the continued existence of the cloistered
orders, the reasonableness of this demand. We do not as a
rule say bitter things when a person of artistic or speculative
genius leaves the family group and goes to Paris or Oxford
in order that his special powers may be educated and become
effective for life; nor should we feel resentment because the
mystical genius sometimes feels that the life of the home circle,
or even the normal life of the community, cannot give the
special training which he requires. In a few cases the mystics
have felt a long period of complete isolation to be necessary
to them; but most often they have been accessible to those
who really needed them, and helped these all the more because
of the long periods of silence in which they listened to the
Voice of God, too often inaudible for them, as for us, in the
general bustle of the world. Their point of view has been
beautifully stated by a young French mystic, Elizabeth de
la Trinité, who died a few years ago. “I want,” she says,
“to be all silence, all adoration, that I may penetrate more
and more deeply into God; and become so full of Him that
I can give Him in my prayers to those poor souls still ignorant
of His gift.” She wants to be a channel, a duct, by which
the love and power of God, of which she is so strongly conscious,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>can flow out to other souls. It is not for herself that
she is working; it is for the world. Do we not find expressed
there both the individual longing and the corporate responsibility
of the mystic? And do we not touch here the intimate
connection which should exist between the separate life of
the great mystic and the corporate life of the church? On
the one hand, the highly organized society, making it possible
for the contemplative to develop his special powers in a
harmonious environment and preventing the frittering of his
energies; on the other, that contemplative, like a special
organ developed by the Body of Christ, gaining for the whole
community contacts and certitudes, which it could not gain
in any other way. News of God can only enter the temporal
order through some human consciousness. Is it unreasonable
that for so great an office certain individuals should be set
apart—within the community, not over against it—and
should live in a special way?</p>

<p class='c005'>As a matter of fact, the church has gained a thousandfold
by her acquiescence in the special vocation of the mystics;
for the treasures they won were never kept for themselves,
but always showered upon her. True, she has not hesitated
to scrutinize and control them; sometimes her attitude has
seemed to the enthusiasts for liberty to be deliberately obscurantist
and tyrannical. Yet, even here—and although
in many cases there has clearly been ignorance, injustice, and
persecution—the mystic gains more than he loses by submission
to the collective judgment. Even in their harshest
form, discipline and tradition are still priceless for him.
First, they school him in the virtue of humility, the very
foundation of the Christian character; which is seldom
possessed by the spiritual genius who always leads and never
submits, and whose triumphant formula, “God and myself!”
too often ends by becoming “Myself and God!”</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>said Jacopone da Todi; that natural rebel who deliberately
submitted himself to an uncongenial religious authority, and
there found perfect freedom.</p>

<p class='c005'>Next, the solid sense of the community, the mere fact that
it always lags behind the more vivid spirits, that the forward-moving
shepherd who sees new pastures has got to take
account of the slowest sheep—all this is a valuable safeguard
against the notorious extravagances of a mysticism unfettered
by authority. It is significant that the greatest mystics
in all communions have ever raised up their voices most
earnestly against spiritual license; have been most eager to
submit their soaring intuitions to the witness of their Scriptures
or the corporate feeling of their church. They realize
the fact that they owe to this church the huge debt which
every individual owes to the tradition of his art or of his
trade. The church represents a complete spiritual civilization,
a conserver of values; were it not for her, every new spiritual
genius who arose would have to begin at the beginning, at
the Stone Age of the soul. Instead of that, he finds himself
placed within a social order enriched by all the contributions
of his great predecessors. The bridges are built; the roads
are made and named; his own experiences and discoveries
are made more valid, less terrifying, more comprehensible
to him, because others have been this way before. Compare
the clarity, the sure-footedness as one may say, of Ruysbroeck,
of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Catherine of Siena, of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Teresa, with the
entanglements, the sense of wandering in beautiful but
trackless places, which one feels when reading even Boehme,
Fox, or Blake; and others are far less coherent than they.
Man needs a convention, a tradition, a limitation, if he is not
to waste his creative powers; and this convention the mystics
find best and most easily in the forms of the church to which
they belong.</p>

<p class='c005'>So we see that the corporate life of his church gives the
mystic a good deal. What does he, on his part, give to it?</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Those who see in the mystic chiefly one who rebels against,
or has no use for, the corporate religious life, and acknowledges
no authority but that of his own spiritual intuitions,
usually conceive of his experiences as having value for himself
alone. He cannot, they say, communicate them or teach
others to share them. Often, therefore, he is spoken of as
useless, selfish, other-worldly: a “lonely soul.” These
phrases suggest that those who use them have a very narrow
view of usefulness, a very materialistic view of the Body of
Christ, and a very unevangelical view of the relative positions
of Mary and Martha. As a matter of fact, the mystic,
instead of being useless, selfish, and other-worldly, is useful,
unselfish, and this-worldly. He is a creative personality,
consecrated to the great practical business of actualizing the
eternal order within the temporal; and although the pursuit
of this business brings him hours of exquisite joy, it brings
him hours of great suffering too—suffering which is gladly
and patiently endured. He does it, or tries to do it, not
because he seeks the joy, but solely for love—love of God,
love of his fellow-men—for he is perpetuating in a certain
sense the work of Christ, mediating between his brethren and
Divine Reality. Hence, where he is fully developed, he will,
as Ruysbroeck tells us, swing like a pendulum between contemplation
and action, between adoration of God and service
of man. In him life has evolved her most powerful spiritual
engine; and she uses it not for the next world, but for this
world, for the eternalization of the here and now, the making
of it more real and more divine, more fully charged with the
grandeur of God. Often the mystic’s special work is done
in a positive and obvious fashion which should satisfy the
most practical mind, and which is yet wholly actuated by
his central intention, that of raising up—as he sometimes
says—new children of the Eternal Goodness, bringing back
the corporate life to a closer contact with God. “My little
children, of whom I travail,” says <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul to his converts.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>There is a typical mystic speaking of his life-work. Can we
call <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Francis of Assisi, the most devoted and original of
missionaries; <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Joan of Arc, re-making the consciousness of
France by the most active of methods; <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Catherine of Siena,
purifying the Italian Church; <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Teresa, regenerating the
whole Carmelite Order, and leaving upon it a stamp it has
never lost; “lazy contemplatives”? Or <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Catherine of
Genoa, the devoted superintendent of a great hospital, who
never permitted her hours of ecstatic communion with God
to interfere with her duty to the sick?</p>

<p class='c005'>Taken as a class, the Christian mystics are distinguished
by nothing so much as by their heroic and unselfish activities;
by their varied and innumerable services to the corporate
life of the church. From their ranks have come missionaries,
preachers, prophets, social reformers, poets, founders of
institutions, servants of the poor and the sick, patient guides
and instructors of souls. We sometimes forget that even
those known chiefly by the writings they have left behind
them have sacrificed to the difficult task of reducing their
transcendent experience to words, hours in which—were the
popular idea of the mystic a true one—they might have been
idly basking in the Divine Light. But these practical activities,
though often great, are only a part of the mystic’s contribution
to the corporate life. If his special claim to
communion with the Transcendent be true at all—and this
argument is based on the assumption that there is at least
some truth in it—then he does really tap a source of vitality
higher than that with which other men have contact. In the
language of theology, he has not merely “efficient” but also
“extraordinary” grace; a larger dower of life, directly
dependent on his larger, more generous love. This is a
claim to which his strange triumphs over circumstance, his
conquests over ill-fortune, ill-health, oppositions and deprivations
of every kind, give weight. Not many strong
and normal persons would willingly face, or indeed endure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>the hardships which <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Francis, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Joan of Arc,
St. Teresa, gladly and successfully embraced.</p>

<p class='c005'>This larger and intenser vitality the mystic does not and
cannot keep to himself. He infects with it all with whom he
comes in contact, kindles the latent fire in them: for the
spiritual consciousness is caught, not taught. Under his
influence—sometimes from the mere encounter with his
personality—other men begin to live a more real, a more
eternal life. Ruysbroeck says that the Spirit of God, when
it is truly received into a soul, becomes a spreading light;
and history confirms this. Corporate experience of God
always begins in a personal experience of God. The rise of
Christianity is the classic illustration of this truth; but
Hindu and Moslem religious history also declare it. Round
each of the great unitive mystics little groups of ardent
disciples, of spiritual children, have grown up. This is true
both of those who remained within and those who seceded
from the official Church—for instance, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Bernard, Eckhart,
<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Francis, Tauler, Ruysbroeck, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Catherine of Siena, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Catherine of Genoa, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Teresa, Boehme, Fox. Nor did
their influence cease with death.</p>

<p class='c005'>Further, in reckoning up the value of the mystics to the
church as a whole, we sometimes forget the extent to which
that church is indebted to mystic intuition for the actual
data upon which her corporate life is based. Christianity,
it is true, is fundamentally a historical religion; but it is
also a religion of experience, and its very history deals quite
as much with the events which attend human intercourse
with the Transcendent and Eternal as with concrete and
visible happenings in space and time. The New Testament
is thick with reports of mystical experiences. The Fourth
Gospel and the Epistles of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul depend for their whole
character on the soaring mystical genius their writers possessed.
Had <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul never been caught up to the third
heaven, he would have had a very different outlook on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>world, and Christianity would have been a different religion
in consequence. Had the Fourth Evangelist never known
what it was to feel the sap of the Mystic Vine flow through
him, his words would have lacked their overwhelming certitude.
So, too, the liturgies bear the stamp of mystical
feeling, and most of the great religious concepts which
the church has gradually added to her store come from the
same source. If we ask ourselves what the history of the
church would be without the history of her mystics, then
we begin to see how much of her light and colour emanates
from them; how much of her doctrine represents their
experience translated into dogmatic form. That communion
with—that feeding on—the Divine Life which she offers to
every believer in the Eucharist is the central fact of their
existence. From Clement of Alexandria downwards, again
and again they appeal to Eucharistic images in order to
express what it is that really happens to the soul immersed
in contemplative prayer. “I am the food of the full-grown,”
said the voice of God to <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Augustine. “Every time we
think with love of the Well-beloved, He is anew our meat
and drink,” says Ruysbroeck. So, too, the church’s language
concerning new birth, divine sonship, regeneration, union
with Christ, and the whole concept of grace, regarded as a
transcendent life and love perpetually pressing in on
humanity—all this is of mystical origin, and represents not the
speculations but the concrete experience of the great mystics.
They are pushed out, as it were, by the visible church like
tentacles, to explore the unseen world which surrounds her,
and drawn back again to her bosom that they may impart
to the whole body the more abundant life which they have
found. Were it not for the unfailing family of the mystics,
thus perpetually pushing out beyond the protective edges of
the organism, and bringing back official Christianity into
direct touch with the highest spiritual values, and so constantly
reaffirming the fact—by them felt and experienced—of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>the intimate correspondence, the regenerating contact
of God with the soul, the church would long ago have fallen
victim to that tendency to relapse into the mechanical which
dogs all organized groups. Then the resistance which she has
sometimes offered to the freshness and novelty, the adventurous
quality of the mystical impulse, where it has appeared
without preparation and sought to correct by its own overwhelming
certitude the spiritual conventions of the day,
would have become that hopeless inertia which is the precursor
of death.</p>

<p class='c005'>So we may best look upon the great Christian mystic as
a special organ developed within the Christian body for a
special use. His peculiar sensibilities, like those which condition
artistic genius, are the gates through which messages
from the Transcendent come to man. He is finding and
feeling the Infinite; not for himself, but for us. His achievement,
bridging the gap which lies between the normal mind
and the supersensuous world, makes more valid and more
actual to us the assumptions upon which external religion
is built; vindicating the church’s highest claim, and hence
the soul’s highest claim—the claim that achievement of
Eternal Life, communion with ultimate reality, is possible
to the spirit of man. More, since all human lives interpenetrate,
and isolation is impossible save in death, the more
we, the social group, are willing to accept the claim of the
mystic, and receive what he tells us in a spirit of humility
instead of a spirit of criticism; the more completely he will
be able to share his treasure with us, the more deeply we
shall be able to enter into that consciousness which he represents,
which he brings in his own person into the human
scheme.</p>

<p class='c005'>This, of course, the Christian church has said far more
beautifully and exactly in her doctrine of the Communion of
Saints; and that doctrine, rightly understood, is indeed the
key to the connection between the great mystics and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>corporate life within which they arise. Were the activities
of these more vital spirits wholly hidden from us, wholly
silent and supersensual—as they are not—it would be a
grossly materialistic and violently un-Christian judgment
which concluded from this that their lives were useless save
to themselves. How can a life which aims at God be useless,
if we believe that achievement of Him is the final destiny and
only satisfaction of every soul? It would be an implicit
denial of the efficacy of prayer, of the “prevailing merits”
of sanctity, its value to the society which produces it—the
power of a great and loving spirit to help, infect and reinforce
more languid souls—did we agree that the life of the most
strictly enclosed contemplative was wasted. Christians, who
believe that the world was redeemed from within the narrow
limits of Palestine, should not thus confuse space with power,
or character with the manner of its self-expression. Without
the ardent prayers of the mystics, the vivid spiritual life
they lead, what would the sum of human spirituality be?
How can we tell what we owe to the power which they liberate,
the currents which they set up, the contacts which they
make? The land they see, and of which they report to us,
is the land towards which humanity is going. They are like
the look-out men upon the cross-trees, assuring us from time
to time that we are still upon our course. Tear asunder
their peculiar power and office from the office of the whole,
and you will have on one side a society deprived of the guides
which God has raised up for it; on the other, an organ deprived
of its real perfection and beauty, because severed
from the organism which it was intended to serve.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>
  <h2 id='chap03' class='c004'>MYSTICISM AND THE DOCTRINE OF ATONEMENT</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'>Amongst the problems which have to be met by those who
incline to a mystical view of Christianity—that view which
lays special emphasis on the growth and experience of the
individual soul, its ascent to union with God, as the very
aim and object of religion—one of the most pressing is that
which centres on the doctrine of the Atonement. It is
clear that many people feel that such a mystical and empirical
view of religion leaves no room for this doctrine, or for the
idea which it represents; that they are convinced that there
is here a real conflict between two incompatible views of the
Christian faith. On the one hand, they see orthodox Christianity
still centred on the “atoning act” of Christ, with its
implications of reconciliation and vicarious suffering, of the
divine life humiliating itself, in order to do within the temporal
order something for man which man cannot do for himself;
a doctrine which retains its attraction and value, because so
full of hope and mercy for the sinful and the weak. On the
other hand, they see that demand of personal and individual
growth, purification, life-enhancement, progressive union with
God—helped doubtless by grace, but no less dependent on
will—as the condition of attaining Eternal Life, which seems
to be made by mystical theology. The opposition, in fact, is
supposed to be between a concept of spiritual life in which
each man must himself do and be, achieve and actualize in his
own person, and not merely as the acceptor of a creed or the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>member of a Church—must not only accept the gift, but must
set himself to be an imitator, so far as he may, of the Giver—and
one in which a special manifestation in time and space
of the divine power and love, for Christians the sacrifice of
Christ on the Cross, does something for the man accepting
it, which he cannot do for himself. In the one case, we are
saved one by one, by effort, response, growth; in the other,
we are saved as members of a group. Here the individual
and the corporate ideals in their most intense forms face one
another.</p>

<p class='c005'>It does, then, seem at first as though we had here an irreconcilable
opposition. Yet before we discard either of these
ideas, it is worth while to enquire whether they need really
entail conflict, or can be regarded as two sides of a greater
whole. It is true that there are certain extreme views of
the Atonement which do appear to be hopelessly irreconcilable
with the mystical view of religion: especially those
which lay peculiar stress, not on the latent powers, but on
the essential impotence of man; centring the soul’s salvation
on “imputed righteousness,” and finding the whole meaning
and reason of the Incarnation in the one historical “propitiatory
act” of Calvary. There is real conflict between
such a creed, centred on the idea of something done once for
all <i>to</i> the soul—to the world—from outside, and that which
is centred on the idea of a life perpetually welling up <i>in</i> the
soul, on growth, movement, organic change. Yet, on the
other hand, is there not a curious similarity between these
two apparently opposite views of salvation? Is not the
drama of the divine life incarnate, humbling and limiting
itself to the human life to save it, essentially a dramatic
representation of that other experience, of the divine life
limiting itself and mysteriously emerging within each soul,
to transmute, regenerate, infinitize it, which the mystics
describe to us? Is not what theologians call “grace”—that
essential factor of the mystic life-process—a making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>good by the addition of a new dower of transcendent vitality,
of the shortcomings of the merely human creature regarded
as an “inheritor of Eternal Life”; just as the historical
surrender of Calvary is conceived by orthodox Christianity
to make good the shortcomings of the whole race, regarded as
heirs of the Kingdom? And if this be so, then can the
opposition between these two ideas of salvation—the vital
and the theological—be as real as it sometimes appears?
Are they not both plans in which atonement plays a part?</p>

<p class='c005'>After all, both these views of the Christian scheme have
emerged and diverged from the same source. <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul, the
greatest of all Christian mystics—soaked, too, in the idea of
grace and of growth in grace, and deeply impressed with the
fact of the soul’s individual responsibility—is also supremely
the theologian of the Atonement. Though no doubt his
teaching on the subject was first called forth by the practical
need of finding some meaning in the tragedy of the crucifixion,
it is yet a development of that profound conception of His
own death as a filling up to the brim of the cup of sacrifice and
surrender, which seems to have inspired Christ Himself. If
there were indeed a fundamental inconsistency between these
two ideas in their pure and original form, then <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul would
be inconsistent; for he certainly held them both. We all
know that the usual way of studying <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul’s “doctrines”
for purposes of edification has been to isolate each of his ardent
and poetic utterances, place it, as it were, in cold storage till
it is no longer reminiscent of the living mobile body from
which it came, and then subject it to analysis. We are also
beginning to know that this method is not quite fair to a man
who was a poet, an artist, a lover, as well as a constructive
genius of unequalled power. The Pauline utterances are
mostly impassioned efforts to express something which Paul
knows in his own person; descriptions of the way in which the
Christian revelation has met his own needs, regenerated his
own nature. They are closely connected with the interior
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>adventures which have attended on his new spiritual existence
“in Christ.” To adopt a well-known phrase of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Bonaventura,
they come “of grace, not of doctrine; of desire, not
of intellect; of the ardours of prayer, not of the teaching of
the schools.” To put it in another way, they are the fruits
of his mystical consciousness, which he is trying to express in
artistic or intellectual terms. If we accept this statement
then the fact of Paul’s mystical experience and all that it
means to him must never be absent from our minds when we
are trying to understand his declarations. He lives in that
supernal atmosphere which he calls “Christ-Spirit”; he
speaks to us from that sphere. Nothing outside of it is real
to him. Whatever its other bearings may be, his doctrine of
Atonement is solidly real on that plane—the mystic’s plane,
the plane of union—or not at all. When he says he is “crucified
<i>with</i> Christ,” “hid in God <i>with</i> Christ,” he means these
things. They are not vaguely pious utterances, but desperate
attempts towards the communication of a real state, really
felt and known. Paul does feel himself welded together with
that Transcendent Life, at once so intimate and personal, so
infinite and universal, which he identifies with the glorified
Jesus. Because of this union—and only because of it—the
acts, powers, holiness, adventures of that life avail for him,
Paul. He is a bit of its Body, in his own bold metaphor.
So that the first great factor of salvation, as he sees it, is the
essentially mystical factor of the “union” of the soul with
Christ; the “doing away of the flame of separation.” The
Atonement follows, as it were almost logically, from this.</p>

<p class='c005'>The general content of his letters makes us feel that <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Paul had an extremely rich, deep view of life; so great,
indeed, that it refuses to be hammered into a consistent
system, and we can never manage to embrace it all at once.
Always bits get left out, and hence there is apt to be a certain
distortion in all our views of the Pauline universe. There
was a wonderful wholeness, a strongly affirmative quality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>about his sense of existence; subtractions and negations were
unnatural to him. Any paradoxes and inconsistencies which
we find in his statements are the inevitable result of an effort
to express the enormous sweep, the living multiplicity, and
(to borrow a word from William James) the thickness of his
vision of Reality. Hence it follows that he was able to see
and treat the soul of man, both as intensely individual and
responsible, and at the same time as a part of the body of all
life; that “mystical body of many members” of which the
head is Christ-Spirit, the Divine Humanity which appeared
in Jesus—a corporation actualized in the Christian Church,
but potentially co-extensive with the whole of mankind.
These two—the separate and the corporate—are aspects of
one whole. They seem to us to conflict, only because the
totality to which they contribute is beyond the focus of the
mind. Thus Paul could and did demand of the individual,
on the one hand the self-mergence of faith, the corporate
sense, the humble acknowledgment of personal impotence;
and on the other hand, could demand of that same man the
personal industry and self-dependence which “works out its
<i>own</i> salvation,” “runs for an imperishable garland,” and
“presses on towards the goal.”</p>

<p class='c005'>All through those passages in the Epistle to the Romans
on which the doctrine of the Atonement was afterwards built,
Paul seems to be trying to express—often by the use of
traditional images, which of course revenge themselves
upon his free handling of them, as imagery so often revenges
itself upon poets—his vision of something supreme, some
enormous uplift to eternal levels, some fundamental change,
achieved by, for, in the human race. He has this vision
just because, and in so far as, this supreme thing has been
achieved by, for, in him, the mystic Paul. Behind the
formula, we feel the first-hand experience. What is this
crucial change? Surely it is the fundamental mystical
achievement, the fundamental religious fact; the human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>soul’s conscious attainment of God. At bottom, atonement is
wanted simply and solely to help man to do that; to enable
the spirit of life to reach its goal. If we did not want God,
we should be very well satisfied as we are: but we are not
satisfied—“Thou hast made us for Thyself, and our hearts
shall find no rest save in Thee.” No doubt Paul’s eschatological
views, the whole tendency of his time, made him
connect this achievement, which he knew at first hand, with
the imminent coming of a Liberator. For him, it was part
of the preparation, the new vitality already given to those who
were destined to live the new life. Achieved in one, it permeated
the whole “new race” of spiritual men; but this is
only the interpretation which a complex of causes made him
put upon the transcendent fact. The prominence given to
Paul’s legal imagery, its isolation from the general trend of
his life and thought, has made us inclined to forget all this.
But if we try to see Reality from his angle, to catch the wild
accents of his enthusiasm and his love, the theory that he
seriously held anything approaching what would be called a
“commercial” theory of atonement falls to the ground at
once. That he should sometimes have argued in this sense
when cornered by Judaizing opponents, is likely enough:
and it is characteristic of the mystical temperament to ignore
the discrepancy between such intellectual exercises and the
fundamental intuition by which it lives. Life and love are
as much the key-words of Paul’s system as they are of the
Fourth Gospel itself. He was the noblest of souls; and we
cannot imagine a soul with a spark of nobility wanting atonement
as a buying-off of penalty incurred, as a paying by
another of a debt which it owes, a mere saving of it from pain
or any other retribution. The living, loving soul can only
want atonement as a road-making act; a bridge thrown
out to the infinite, on which man can travel to his home in
God. Now, Paul had made that journey in the spirit. He
knew already, at first hand, that Divine Reality was accessible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>to him, and that this contact was the greatest thing in life.
But he knew and felt, too, that however much he, Paul, had
really achieved this new state, this fruition of Eternity, by
difficult growth from within; yet first, he could never have
done it at all without the enormous uplift of enhancing grace,
that new dower of energy which was poured in on him from
beyond the confines of his own nature; and secondly, great
though the change had been, yet it was nothing compared
with the immeasurable human possibilities achieved in Christ.</p>

<p class='c005'>For Paul, these two achievements—the victory of Christ and
the victory of the Christian soul—are intimately connected.
True, one is infinitely great, the other very little. Except
Christ, “all have fallen short of the glory”; have failed to
grow up to the “fullness of the stature,” to actualize the
immense spiritual possibilities of man. Still, we are all in
the same line; partakers of the same kind of life, “grace”
or immanent Spirit, and aiming, consciously or unconsciously,
at the same goal—union with God. Now, total dependence
on God, the centring of our whole interest and attention on
the Spiritual Order, is the very essence of union with Him.
Everything short of that total dependence, that supreme
rightness of relation, is trespass; a backing of the finite against
the infinite. In the death of Jesus, that total dependence,
that perfect relation, was completely achieved at last: the
supreme mystic act, the self-donation of love, was done
perfectly, and in this sense “once for all.” <i>Aleph, it is enough.</i>
The spirit of man, in this “new man,” had overcome its limitations,
the downward drag of instinct, and had leapt to the
heights. This was the “redemption that is in Christ Jesus.”
In this unique vindication of humanity, this exhibition of
regnant spirit overcoming the world, Christ-Spirit crowned
with splendour all the tentative efforts of man, and, because
of the corporate nature of humanity, conferred that splendour
on the race.</p>

<p class='c005'>But there is far more in it than this. And first, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Christian’s achievement of God, such as it is—from that of the
least of believers to that of the greatest of the mystical saints—is
really and practically conditioned by the known fact and
known character of the achievement of Christ. It is the
addition of this fact, this distinct historic happening, to the
racial consciousness, which makes possible the specially
Christian apprehension of God; differentiates it, say, from
that of a Hindu or a Neoplatonic saint. A reference to the
phenomena of apperception will help us to understand this.
As in the world of nature or art our perception of each new
object is governed by the images and ideas already dominant
within the mind, so, too, in the religious sphere. If Christians
had not got the idea of Calvary in their consciousness—if the
image of the surrender of Jesus, His sublime exhibition of
love and faith, were not there first as a clue, something about
which to group and arrange their spiritual intuitions—it
would make a vital difference to their interpretation of the
relation of the soul to God; and this means that the relation
itself would be quite different for the conscious self, other
elements would be stressed, and different results would flow
from it. It is only because the sacrifice of Jesus is now part
of the Christian’s “apperceiving mass”—because, coming
to the contemplation of the spiritual world, he inevitably
brings the Cross with him—that he is able to make the characteristically
Christian contact with God. That Christian
contact is a direct gift to him, from the historic Person and
the historic act. We approach the Transcendent Order <i>with</i>
that, or, as Paul tersely puts it, “in Christ”; and our fruition
of Reality results, not, as some extreme mystics have liked
to think, from any “naked apprehension”—for naked apprehension
has no meaning, no content, for the mind—but from
a fusion of that which we bring with us and that to which we
ascend; tradition and experience, the past and the present.
Through love of Christ the Christian comes to the Cross, and
through the Cross he enters a spiritual region he could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>reach in any other way. So we find that even for the most
transcendental of Christian contemplatives, still “in the Cross
all doth consist.” It has for him a terror and a rapture which
the judicious philosopher can never know; and reveals to
him strange secrets beyond the province of philosophy.</p>

<p class='c008'>That Cross gives the Infinite a colour which it did not have
before. So, even from the point of view of the most hardened
and thorough-going psychologist, Paul’s statement that
“through one act of righteousness, the free gift came unto all
men” is literally accurate. It is true—and that not in any
conjuring-trick sense, but in a sense which fulfils on highest
levels life’s basic laws—that “by the grace of one man”
“the gift has abounded to the many,” entincturing and
altering the whole universe, and hence the whole experience,
of every receptive soul; atoning for the faulty attitude, the
imperfect love, of average man.</p>

<p class='c005'>But still this is not all. There are other laws of life gathered
up in, and redistributed from, this great lens. Essentially
the idea which the Christ of the Gospels seems to have had of
His own death is the idea of a making good of some general
falling-short on life’s part: a “filling-up of the cup” of
sacrifice and surrender, to balance the other overflowing cup
of error and sin. It is not only man’s unaccomplished aim,
but God’s unaccomplished aim in life, which He is represented
as fulfilling; and the fact that this conception owes a good deal
to Old Testament prophecy need not invalidate its mystical
truth. If we accept this idea, then, as well as showing
individual man the way to perfect union with God—“building
the bridge and reforming the road which leads to the Father’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>heart,” as <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Catherine of Siena has it—Christ in His willing
death is somehow performing the very object of life, in the
name of the whole race. The true business of an atoner is a
constructive one. He is called upon to heal a disharmony;
bridge a gap between two things which, though separate, desire
to be one. Even the sacrificed animal of primitive religions
seems most often to be a reconciling victim, the medium of
union between the worshipper and his deity. In religions of
a mystical type, then, the Atoner or Redeemer will surely be
one who makes patent those latent possibilities of man which
are at once the earnests of his future blessedness and the
causes of his present unrest. He will achieve the completion
and sublimation of our vague instinct for sacrifice and love,
and thus bridge the space between that which is most divine
in humanity and that which is most human in divinity;
filling up the measure of that “glory,” that real and divine
life, of which we all fall short, yet without which we can never
be content. Is not this again what <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul feels that Christ
did? What he seems, at bottom, to see in the Passion—though
the imagery by which he tries to communicate it
often sounds harsh in our ears—is, the mysterious fulfilment
of all cosmic meanings; the perfect surrender to infinite ideals
of Man, the compound inhabitant of two possible orders of
reality, who by this painful self-loss achieves perfect identification
with the Divine will. This fulfilment was, as he distinctly
says, the duty and destiny of the human soul. All creation
looks for it “with outstretched neck.” But all have fallen
short. Christ, the perfect man, does it, does what man was
always meant to do; and because of the corporate character
of humanity, in His utter transcendence of self-hood and of all
finite categories He inevitably lifts up, to share His union
with God, all who are in union with Him. The essence of the
Atonement, then, would not lie so much in the sacrificial
act as in the lift-up of the human spirit which that act
guarantees; the new levels of life which it opens for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>race. “Much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved <i>in
his life</i>,” says Paul.</p>

<p class='c005'>“In his life” a new summit has been conquered by
humanity. But are we to stop there? Is not the attainment
of that same summit, the achievement of that life-giving
surrender to the Universal Spirit—“a life-giving life,” Ruysbroeck
calls it—just what the great mystics, following as well
as they can the curve of the life of Christ, try to do according
to their measure? Theirs, after all, is the vision which sees
that “there is no other way to <i>life</i> but the way of the Cross,”
and that the human life of Christ is “the door by which all
must come in.” Thus the spiritual victory of the Cross is
for them not so much a unique, as a pioneer act. It is the
first heroic cutting of a road on which they are to travel as
far as they can; not merely the vicarious setting-right of the
balance between God and man, upset by man’s wilful sin.
In their ascent towards union with God, are not they road-makers,
or at any rate road-menders, too? Are they not
forging new links between two orders of reality, which are
separate for the once-born consciousness? If so, then we
may regard each one of them as a bit of the slowly achieved
atonement of the race; that gradual pressing-on of humanity
into the heart of the Transcendent Order. For Christians,
this movement was initiated by Christ. But surely it is continued
and helped by every soul in union with Him, even those
who knew not His Name; and Julian of Norwich was right
when she said that she knew she was “in the Cross with
Him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Two things are perpetually emphasized in modern presentations
of religion. First, the stress tends more and more to be
upon experience. Nothing which authority tells us is done
for us truly counts, unless we feel and realize it as done in us.
In so far as this is so, the tendency is to a mystical concept of
religion; and, speaking generally, to just the concept of
religion which is supposed to conflict with the idea of atonement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>as usually understood. But, secondly, the social and
corporate character of Christianity is strongly emphasized;
and, where this corporate character is admired more than it is
understood, mysticism is harshly criticized as the religion of
the spiritual individualist, a “vertical relation,” the “flight
of the alone to the Alone.” <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul’s “completing opposites,”
in fact, are still in the foreground of our religious life; and so
perhaps some re-statement of the solution by which he found
room for both of them, and hence both for personal responsibility
and atonement, may be possible and fruitful for us, too.</p>

<p class='c005'>And first we notice that those enthusiasts for the corporate
idea who condemn the mystics as religious egoists seem to
forget that they are contradicting themselves; that if their
vision of the Church of Christ as a mystical <i>body</i> be true, then
the mystic’s ascent to God cannot be a flight of the Alone.
The poisonous implication of that phrase—true in its context
but always misunderstood—has stuck like mud to the white
robes of the saints. But the mystic is not merely a self
going out on a solitary quest of Reality. He can, must, and
does go only as a member of the whole body, performing as it
were the function of a specialized organ. What he does, he
does for all. He is, in fact, an atoner pure and simple:
something stretched out to bridge a gap, something which
makes good in a particular direction the general falling-short.
The special kind of light or life which he receives, he receives
for the race; and, conversely, the special growth which he is
able to achieve comes from the race. He depends on it for
his past; it depends on him for its future. All are part of
life’s great process of becoming; there are no breaks. Although
there is perfect individualization, there is interpenetration
too. His attainment is the attainment of the
whole, pressing on behind him, supporting him. Thus—to
take an obvious example—the achievement of peculiar
sanctity by the member of a religious order is the achievement
of that order in him; and this not in a fantastic and metaphorical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>sense. The support of the Rule, the conditions
of the life, the weight of tradition, the special characters which
each religious family inherits from its Patriarch, have all
contributed something to make the achievement possible;
and are factors governing the type which that achievement
assumes. We recognize the Cistercian stamp upon <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Bernard,
the Dominican on Suso and Tauler, the Carmelite on
<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John of the Cross. Each such case vindicates once more
the incarnational principle; it is the true spirit of the community,
flowering in this representative of theirs, which we
see. Thus, as we may regard Christ from one point of view
as supremely ideal Man incarnate—the “heavenly man” as
Paul calls Him—summing up, fulfilling, lifting to new heights
all that came before, and therefore actualizing all that humanity
was ever intended to do, and changing for ever more the
character of its future achievements; so, in a small way, we
may regard <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Teresa as Carmel, the ideal Carmel, incarnate.
Each is a concrete fact which atones for the falling-short of
a whole type, and yet is conditioned by that type. The
thought of what the Carmelite life was meant to do, the
pressure of that idea seeking manifestation, did condition
Teresa’s achievement. Are we not also bound to say that the
thought of the Jewish visions of an ideal humanity, of the Son
of Man and the Suffering Servant, did condition the external
accidents of the life and death of Christ?</p>

<p class='c005'>So as to the past. Still more as to the future are the
corporate and individual aspects of spiritual life inextricably
twined together. As that done by one is an outbirth of
the whole, so that done to one may avail for the whole. Only
by staying within the circle of this thought—a thought which
surely comes very close to the doctrine of Atonement—can
we form a sane and broad idea of what the mystic, and the
mystic’s experience, mean for the race. Consider again the
case of Teresa. As, even in a time and place of considerable
monastic corruption—for no one who has read her life and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>letters can regard the Convent of the Incarnation as a forcing-house
of the spiritual life—still the idea of her order conditioned
her great and Godward-tending soul, and her dedicated
life filled up the measure of its glory; yet more has
Teresa’s own, separate, unique achievement conditioned
the spirit of her order ever since. All the saints which it
has nourished have been salted with her salt. All that she
won has flowed out from her in life-giving streams to others.
She has been a regenerator of the religious life, has achieved
the ideal of Richard Rolle, and become a “pipe of life”
through which the living water can pass from God to man.
Is not this, too, rather near the idea of Atonement, a curiously
close and faithful imitation of Christ; especially when we
consider the amount of unselfish suffering which such a career
entails?</p>

<p class='c005'>The objective of the Christian life, we say, is union with
God: that paradoxical victory-in-surrender of love which
translates us from finite to infinite levels. Most of us in this
present life and in our own persons fall short of the glory of
this. We are not all equally full of grace; we do not all grow
up to the full stature of the Sons of God; and it is no use
pretending that we do. But the mystical saint does achieve
this, and by this act of mediation—this “vicarious” achievement,
if you like to put it so—performed by a member of
our social organism, the gift does really “abound unto the
many.” For what other purpose, indeed, are these apparently
elect souls bred up? What other social value can we
attribute to them than that which we see them actually
possessing in history—the value, that is, of special instruments
put forth by the race, to do or suffer something which
the average self cannot do, but which humanity as a whole,
in its Godward ascent, must, can, and shall do; ducts, too,
whereby fresh spiritual energy flows in to mankind; eyes,
open to visions beyond the span of average sight; parents of
new life. Carlyle said that a hero was “a man sent hither
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>to make the divine mystery more impressively known to us”—to
atone, in fact, for the inadequacy of our own perception
of Reality, our perpetual relapses to lower levels of life; to
make a bridge between us and the Transcendent Order.
And when the hero as mystic does this, is he not in a special
sense a close imitator of Christ?</p>

<p class='c005'>We seem to have here the highest example of a principle
which is operative through the whole of the seething complex
of life, for there is a sense on which every great personality
fulfils the function of an atoner. On the one hand he does
something towards the making good of humanity’s “falling
short” in one direction or another; on the other hand, he
gives to his fellow-men—adds to their universe—something
which they did not possess before. Burke, speaking of the
social contract, has said that society is a partnership in all
science, all art, every virtue, and all perfection; and, since
the ends of such a partnership cannot be obtained but in
many generations, it is a partnership between the living, the
dead, and the unborn. “Each contract of each particular
state,” he says, “is but a clause in the great primæval contract
of eternal society, <i>linking the lower with the higher natures</i>,
connecting the visible and the invisible world, according to a
fixed compact sanctioned by the inviolable oath which holds
all physical and all moral natures each in their appointed
place.” In such a partnership—linking higher and lower,
visible and invisible worlds in one—the creative spirits in
every department of life may properly be called “atoners,”
for they have a corporate and racial value which is in exact
proportion to their individual achievement of reality. Thus
the great artist, or the great musician, really redeems his
fellows from slavery to a lower level of colour, form, sound.
He atones for their dullness towards that which has always
been there, and endows them with new possibilities of vision
and hearing; gives them, in fact, more abundant life; is
the Door, the Way, to a wider universe. His creative acts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>open new gates to the whole race. The fact that he has lived
and worked has effected a permanent change in the stream of
life, which can never again be that which it was before. If
we were more accustomed, on the one hand, to look at the
achievements of religious genius from the artistic and creative
point of view, and on the other hand, to discern the work of
the Holy Spirit in the artistic as well as the religious field,
I believe that we should find a close parallel between the work
of supreme personality redeeming spirit, and the work of the
great artist redeeming sense, from servitude to old imperfections
and disharmonies.</p>

<p class='c005'>We might almost make it the test of true greatness, this
wonderful power of flinging out the filaments of life in all
directions; this way in which noble and creative personalities
of every type seem to be so much more than themselves—to
count for so much more than themselves—to be, in their
generous activities, the servants of all life. They appear to
be the sum of tendencies which preceded them; and to gather
those tendencies to a focus and distribute them again, enhanced
and re-directed, to succeeding generations of souls. Such a
personality has to the full the divine power of giving and of
taking. Whilst he seems specially original, it is always true
that the past, the race, nourishes him to an enormous extent.
Christ Himself conformed to this law. The great man is
rooted in history, plaited up in the life of his own time:
absorbs from the human as well as from the spiritual. His
feet are in Time, though his head is in Eternity.  He is never
isolated and ring-fenced. Where he seems so, that appearance
is found on examination to be deceptive, as Dr. Rufus
Jones has shown in the case of Jacob Boehme, and Baron
von Hügel in that of George Fox. So, again, the special act,
vision, or experience of the spiritual genius never ends with
him. He is a centre of divine fecundity—it is the mystics’
own phrase. The touch of the divine life stimulates him to
creation. He is a regenerator, a whirlpool of new forces, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>parent of new things. It seems that life’s “tendency to lag
behind,” its tendency <i>not</i> to do its best, receives its corrective
in all such great spirits; and the Christian atonement becomes
the supreme, the divine manifestation of a vital law which we
find operative on every level of existence.</p>

<p class='c005'>If we acknowledge the extent to which Grace, Spirit,
God, works on man through personality, through specific
men—as a communication of transcendent vitality to certain
souls (“elect,” if you like) in order that they may bring forth
new life, new vision, new goodness, may fertilize the race
afresh—then shall we not expect to find that Christianity,
being a vital, dynamic system, has exhibited and emphasized
these facts throughout the whole of her great career? This
outward thrust of great personalities from the social organism,
these fresh unique saving contacts made by the individual
in the name of the All, these sudden, incalculable, upward
leaps of life, these changes in the national consciousness which
the hero, poet, prophet can produce—we shall expect to find
all this operative in the highest degree in the Christian Church.
We shall expect to find her claiming for her greatest and
most God-achieving spirits, not only special honour, but a
special value, a special redeeming power in respect of the
corporate body to which they belong; and this, of course,
is exactly what we do find. The mystical saints, in fact,
seem to provide us with a link between the doctrine of the
Atonement—of the special racial value of the utterly surrendered
life in God, which was once, and once only, perfectly
achieved—and the doctrine of the Communion of Saints,
or interpenetration and mutual help of all souls “in Christ.”
From these two ideas there follows of necessity that further
doctrine of the “prevailing merits” of the saints, their
special “atoning” value for other men, the corporate social
work done by heroic virtue flowering in individual souls, which
the Catholic Church has always deduced from them. At
the back of both ideas we find the same fact; that Life and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>Love, when supremely evoked within the temporal order,
cannot keep themselves to themselves. Such life and such
love have, in spite of their marked individuality, a profoundly
social character; they are violently contagious; they spread,
they interpenetrate, they transmute all selves that will
receive them. They entincture the whole stream of duration,
make good its shortcomings, make widening circles of splendour
within the flux.</p>

<p class='c005'>So, if we want to think of a Celestial Hierarchy, actual
to us, founded in history, related with us by a thousand
links, it is surely of the saints and the mystics that we ought to
think; rising as it were in graduated orders, according to the
strength and purity of their union with God, the fullness of
their possession of Eternal Life, towards the Cross in which
their tendencies are perfected and gathered up. These are
amongst the highest values which life has given to us. The
apostolic type; the men of action, dynamic manifestations
of the Spirit. The prophetic type; men of supreme vision,
enlarging the horizons of the world. The martyr-type;
men of utter sacrifice and complete interior surrender. These
are the three ways in which the mystical passion for God
breaks out through humanity. These three types make good—atone
for—our corporate spiritual shortcomings; redeem
the dead level of that race which has thrust them forth towards
the Infinite.</p>

<p class='c005'>Perhaps it seems to us that their difference from us is
too great; that they are cut off, divided by a chasm from
the common experience of man to form an exclusive, “other-worldly”
type. Their life rises up like a great mountain,
full of beauty and strangeness; and ours is like the homely
plain. But there is no break between the plain and the
mountain. It is pushed out from us, it is part of us; its
value is bound up with the value of the whole—with our
value, as struggling, growing men. It, every inch of it,
atones for our flatness and enhances the average level of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>race. We have all seen in Catholic countries how a sudden
hill with a Calvary on its summit can glorify and atone for the
whole landscape—so poor without it, so noble with it—from
which it is lifted up. Now the Cross is, and remains, the
central feature in the Christian landscape too: but is it
not the long slope of that hill, going from the common level
to the heights, which makes it so homely to us, so accessible
to us, so supremely a part of us, and completes its task of
linking humanity and divinity?</p>

<p class='c005'>These are some of the reasons why the doctrine of Atonement
seems to be closely bound up with the mystical vision
of life, and hard to understand—whether we mean by it a
spiritual principle or a historic event—without that mystical
vision. We have Christianity saying to us, on the one hand,
that the utmost ideal of humanity, the ideal of perfect self-donation
to the purposes of Spirit, perfect self-surrender to
the interests of the All, was completely and transcendently
achieved in Jesus. In Him man leapt to the heights; and
this unique attainment counts for the whole race. But, on
the other hand, it says that all who can are called to go as
far as they are able on the same road; to “fill up the measure
of the sufferings,” to “grow to the full stature,” to “press
on to the high calling” of the human soul. Through these
more vital personalities—the mystics, the twice-born, the
saints—the radiance of the spiritual streams out on the race;
God speaks to man through man. Such personalities act as
receivers and transmitters; they really and practically
distribute the flashes of the Uncreated Light. Their activities
are vicarious; they do atone for the disabilities of other men.
Therefore the social value of the mystics, their place in the
organism, is intimately connected with the atoning idea.
Were it not for the principle which the doctrine of Atonement
expresses, the mystics would be spiritual individualists, whose
life and experience would be meaningless except for themselves.
And were it not for the continuance of the mystical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>life, the perpetual renewal of the mystical self-donation in
love, its known value for the race, then the historic Atonement
of Jesus would be an isolated act, unrelated to the great
processes of the Spiritual World, of which it should form the
crown.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>
  <h2 id='chap04' class='c004'>THE MYSTIC AS CREATIVE ARTIST</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'>Hostile criticism of the mystics almost invariably includes
the charge that their great experiences are in the nature of
merely personal satisfactions. It is said that they stand
apart from the ruck of humanity, claiming a special knowledge
of the supersensual, a special privilege of communion
with it; yet do not pass on to others, in any real and genuine
sense, the illumination, the intuition of Reality, which they
declare that they have received. <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Bernard’s favourite
mistranslation from Isaiah, “My secret to myself,” has
again and again been used against them with damaging
effect; linked sometimes with the notorious phrase in which
Plotinus defined the soul’s fruition of Eternity as “a flight
of the alone to the Alone.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It is true that these hints concerning a solitary and ineffable
encounter do tally with one side of the experience of the
mystic; do describe one aspect of his richly various, many-angled
spiritual universe, one way in which that divine
union which is his high objective is apprehended by the
surface-consciousness. But that which is here told, is only
half the truth. There is another side, a “completing opposite,”
to this admittedly indescribable union of hearts; a
side which is often—and most ungraciously—forgotten by
those who have received its benefits. The great mystic’s
loneliness is a consecrated loneliness. When he ascends to
that encounter with Divine Reality which is his peculiar
privilege, he is not a spiritual individualist. He goes as the
ambassador of the race. His spirit is not, so to speak, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“spark flying upwards” from this world into that world,
flung out from the mass of humanity, cut off; a little, separate,
brilliant thing. It is more like a feeler, a tentacle, which life
as a whole stretches out into that supersensual world which
envelops her. Life stretches that tentacle out, but she also
draws it in again with the food that it has gathered, the news
that it has to tell of the regions which its delicate tactile
sense has enabled it to explore. This, it seems to me, is
the function of the mystic consciousness in respect of the
human race. For this purpose it is specialized. It receives,
in order that it may give. As the prophet looks at the landscape
of Eternity, the mystic finds and feels it: and both
know that there is laid on them the obligation of exhibiting
it if they can.</p>

<p class='c005'>If this be so, then it becomes clear that the mystic’s personal
encounter with Infinite Reality represents only one of
the two movements which constitute his completed life. He
must turn back to pass on the revelation he has received:
must mediate between the transcendent and his fellow-men.
He is, in fact, called to be a creative artist of the highest
kind; and only when he is such an artist, does he fulfil his
duty to the race.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is coming to be realized more and more clearly that it
is the business of the artist not only to delight us, but to
enlighten us: in Blake’s words, to “Cleanse the doors of
perception, so that everything may appear as it is—infinite.”
Artists mediate between the truth and beauty which they
know, and those who cannot without their help discern it.
It is the function of art, says Hegel, to deliver to the domain
of feeling and delight of vision all that the mind may possess
of essential and transcendent Being. In this respect it
ranks with religion and philosophy as “one of the three
spheres of Absolute Spirit.” Bergson, again, declares that it
is the peculiar business of art to brush aside everything that
veils reality from us, in order to bring us face to face with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>real, the true. The artist is the man who sees things in their
native purity.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Could reality,” he observes in a celebrated passage,
“come into direct contact with sense and consciousness,
could we enter into immediate communion with things and
with ourselves—then, we should all be artists.... Deep in
our souls we should hear the uninterrupted melody of our inner
life: a music often gay, more often sad, always original.
All this is around and within us: yet none of it is distinctly
perceived by us. Between nature and ourselves—more,
between ourselves and our own consciousness—hangs a veil:
a veil dense and opaque for normal men, but thin, almost
transparent, for the artist and poet.” He might have added,
for the mystic too.</p>

<p class='c005'>This veil, he says again, is woven of self-interest: we
perceive things, not as they are, but as they affect ourselves.
The artist, on the contrary, sees them for their own sakes,
with the eyes of disinterested love. So, when the mystics
declare to us that the first conditions of spiritual illumination
are self-simplification, humility and detachment, they are
demanding just those qualities which control the artist’s
power of seeing things in their beauty and truth. The true
mystic sees Reality in its infinite aspect; and tries, as other
artists, to reveal it within the finite world. He not only
ascends, but descends the ladder of contemplation; having
heard “the uninterrupted music of the inner life,” he tries
to weave it into melodies that other men can understand.</p>

<p class='c005'>Bergson’s contemporary, Eucken, claims—and I think it
is one of his most striking doctrines—that man is gradually
but actually bringing into existence a spiritual world. This
spiritual world springs up from within through humanity—that
is, through man’s own consciousness—yet at the same
time humanity is, as it were, growing up into it; finding it
as an independent reality, waiting to be apprehended, waiting
to be incorporated into our universe. In respect of man’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>normal universe, this spiritual world is both immanent and
transcendent: “Absent only from those unable to perceive
it,” as Plotinus said of the <i>Nous</i>. We are reminded of the
Voice which said to <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Augustine, “I am the Food of the
Full-grown.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This paradox of a wholly new order of experience thrusting
itself up through the race which it yet transcends, is a permanent
feature in the teachings of the higher religions and
philosophies, and is closely connected with the phenomena of
inspiration and of artistic creation. The artist, the prophet,
the metaphysician, each builds up from material beyond the
grasp of other souls, a world within which those other souls
can live and dream: a world, moreover, which exhibits in
new proportions and endows with new meanings the common
world of daily life. When we ask what organ of the race—the
whole body of humanity—it is, by and through which
this supernal world thus receives expression, it becomes clear
that this organ is the corporate spiritual consciousness,
emerging in those whom we call, pre-eminently, mystics and
seers. It is, actually and literally, through them that this
new world is emerging and being built up; as it is through
other forms of enhanced and clarified consciousness, in
painters, musicians, philosophers, and the adepts of physical
science, that other aspects of the universe are made known to
men. In all of these, and in the mystic too, the twin powers
of a steadfast, selective attention and of creative imagination
are at work. Because of their wide, deep, attention to life
they receive more news from the external world than others
do; because of the creative cast of their minds, they are able
to weave up the crude received material into a living whole,
into an idea or image which can be communicated to other
men. Ultimately, we owe to the mystics all the symbols,
ideas and images of which our spiritual world, as it is thought
of by the bulk of men, is constructed. We take its topography
from them, at second-hand: and often forget the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>sublime adventures immortalized in those phrases which we
take so lightly on our lips—the Divine Dark, the Beatific
Vision, the Eternal Beauty, Ecstasy, Union, Spiritual Marriage,
and the rest. The mystics have actually created, from
that language which we have evolved to describe and deal
with the time-world, another artistic world; a self-consistent
and spiritually expressive world of imaginative concepts, like
the world of music or the world of colour and form. They
are always trying to give us the key to it, to induct us into
its mysterious delights. It is by means of this world, and
the symbols which furnish it, that human consciousness is
enabled to actualize its most elusive experiences; and hence
it is wholly due to the unselfish labours of those mystics who
have struggled to body forth the realities by which they were
possessed, that we are able, to some extent, to enter into
the special experiences of the mystical saints; and that they
are able to snatch us up to a brief sharing of their vision,
to make us live for a moment “Eternal Life in the midst
of Time.”</p>

<p class='c005'>How, then, have they done this? What is the general
method by which any man communicates the result of his
personal contacts with the universe to other minds? Roughly
speaking, he has two ways of doing this, by description and
by suggestion; and his best successes are those in which these
two methods are combined. His descriptions are addressed
to the intellect, his suggestions are appeals to the imagination,
of those with whom he is trying to communicate. The
necessities which control these two ways of telling the news—oblique
suggestion and symbolic image—practically govern
the whole of mystical literature. The span of this literature
is wide. It goes from the utterly formless, yet infinitely
suggestive, language of certain great contemplatives, to the
crisply formal pictorial descriptions of those whose own
revelations of Reality crystallize into visions, voices, or other
psycho-sensorial experiences. At one end of the scale is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>vivid, prismatic imagery of the Christian apocalypse, at the
other the fluid, ecstatic poetry of some of the Sūfi saints.</p>

<p class='c005'>In his suggestive and allusive language the mystical artist
often approaches the methods of music. When he does this,
his statements do not give information. They operate a
kind of enchantment which dilates the consciousness of the
hearer to a point at which it is able to apprehend new aspects
of the world. In his descriptive passages, on the other hand,
he generally proceeds, as do nearly all our descriptive efforts,
by way of comparison. Yet often these comparisons, like
those employed by the great poet, are more valuable for their
strange suggestive quality than for any exact parallels which
they set up between the mystic’s universe and our own.
Thus, when Clement of Alexandria compares the Logos to
a “New Song,” when Suso calls the Eternal Wisdom a “sweet
and beautiful wild flower,” when Dionysius the Areopagite
speaks of the Divine Dark which <i>is</i> the Inaccessible Light,
or Ruysbroeck of “the unwalled world,” we recognize a
sudden flash of the creative imagination; evoking for us a
truth far greater, deeper and more fruitful than the merely
external parallel which it suggests. So too with many common
metaphors of the mystics: the Fire of Love, the Game of
Love, the Desert of God, the Marriage of the Soul. Such
phrases succeed because of their interior and imaginative
appeal.</p>

<p class='c005'>We have numerous examples of this kind of artistic
language—the highly charged imaginative phrase—in the
Bible; especially in the prophetic books, and the Apocalypse.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters.</div>
      <div class='line'>I will give thee treasures of darkness and hidden riches of secret places.</div>
      <div class='line'>The Lord shall be a diadem of beauty.</div>
      <div class='line'>He showed me a pure river of the water of life.</div>
      <div class='line'>I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters.</div>
      <div class='line'>I saw a new heaven and a new earth.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Whereas the original prophetic significance of these phrases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>is now meaningless for us, their suggestive quality—their
appeal to the mystic consciousness—retains its full force.
They are artistic creations; and have the enormous evocative
power proper to all great art. Later mystics use such passages
again and again, reading their own experiences into
these traditional forms. The classic example of this close
alliance between poetic readings of life and practical mysticism
is of course the mystical interpretation of the <i>Song
of Songs</i>, which appears in Christian mysticism at least as
early as the fourth century. But there are many other
instances. Thus <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Macarius finds in Ezekiel’s vision of
the Cherubim a profoundly suggestive image of the state of
the deified soul, “all eyes and all wings,” driven upon its
course by the Heavenly Charioteer of the Spirit. Thus in
<i>The Mirror of Simple Souls</i>, another of Ezekiel’s visions—that
of the “great eagle, with great wings, long wings, full
of feathers, which took the highest branch of the cedar”—becomes
the vivid symbol of the contemplative mind, “the
eagle that flies high, so right high and yet more high than
does any other bird, for she is feathered with fine love, and
beholds above other the beauty of the sun.”</p>

<p class='c005'>When we pass to the mystical poets, we find that nearly
all their best effects are due to their extraordinary genius
for this kind of indirect, suggestive imagery. This is the
method by which they proceed when they wish to communicate
their vision of reality. Their works are full
of magical phrases which baffle analysis, yet, as one of
them has said:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Lighten the wave-washed caverns of the mind</div>
      <div class='line'>With a pale, starry grace.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Many of these phrases are of course familiar to every one.
Vaughan’s</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I saw Eternity the other night</div>
      <div class='line'>Like a great ring of pure and endless light.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Blake’s</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“To see a world in a grain of sand</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And a heaven in a wild flower,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hold infinity in the palm of your hand,</div>

    </div>
  </div>

<p class='c008'>Whitman’s</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>“Light rare, untellable, lighting the very light.”</div>

      <div class='line'>From the hid battlements of Eternity.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>These are artistic, sidelong representations of the mystic’s
direct apprehension of the Infinite on, so to speak, its cosmic
and impersonal side. Others reflect the personal and intimate
contact with the Divine Life which forms the opposite
side of his complete experience. Thus Francis Thompson:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“With his aureole</div>
      <div class='line'>The tresses of my soul</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Are blent</div>
      <div class='line'>In wished content.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>So, too, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John of the Cross:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“All things I then forgot,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>My cheek on him who for my coming came;</div>
      <div class='line'>All ceased, and I was not,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Leaving my cares and shame</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Among the lilies, and forgetting them.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Best of all, perhaps, Jalāluddin Rūmi:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In a place beyond uttermost place, in a tract without shadow of trace,</div>
      <div class='line'>Soul and body transcending I live, in the soul of my loved one anew.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes the two aspects, personal and impersonal, are
woven together by the poet: and then it is that we come
nearest to an understanding of the full experience he is trying
to express. A remarkable example of this occurs in Gerard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Hopkins, perhaps the greatest mystical poet of the Victorian
era:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>“Thou mastering me</div>
      <div class='line in6'>God! giver of breath and bread;</div>
      <div class='line in4'>World’s strand, sway of the sea;</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Lord of the living and dead;</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou hast bound bones and veins in me, fastened me flesh,</div>
      <div class='line'>And after it almost unmade, what with dread,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Thy doing: and dost thou touch me afresh?</div>
      <div class='line'>Over again I feel thy finger and find thee.”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>“I kiss my hand</div>
      <div class='line in6'>To the stars, lovely-asunder</div>
      <div class='line in4'>Starlight, wafting him out of it; and</div>
      <div class='line in6'>Glow, glory in thunder;</div>
      <div class='line'>Kiss my hand to the dappled-with-damson west:</div>
      <div class='line'>Since, though he is under the world’s splendour and wonder,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>His mystery must be instressed, stressed;</div>
      <div class='line'>For I greet him the days I meet him, and bless when I understand.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>So much for the poets. In the prose writings of the mystics
we find again the same characters, the same high imaginative
qualities, the same passionate effort to give the ineffable
some kind of artistic form. This effort includes in its span
a wide range of literary artifices; some endeavouring to
recapture and represent in concrete symbols the objective
reality known; some, like one dominant art movement
of the present day, trying to communicate it obliquely, by a
representation of the subjective feeling-state induced in the
mystic’s own consciousness. At one end of the scale, therefore,
we have the so-called negative language of mysticism, which
describes the supersensuous in paradox by refusing to describe
it at all; by declaring that the entry of the soul upon spiritual
experience is an entry into a Cloud of Unknowing, a nothing,
a Divine Darkness, a fathomless abyss. The curious thing is,
that though here, if anywhere, the mystic seems to keep his
secret to himself, as a matter of fact it is just this sort of
language which has been proved to possess the highest
evocative power. For many types of mind, this really does
fling magic casements wide; does give us a momentary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>glimpse of the perilous seas. I am inclined to think that,
many and beautiful as are the symbolic and pictorial creations
of mystical genius, it is here that this genius works most
freely, produces its most magnificent results. When Ruysbroeck
speaks of the boundless abyss of pure simplicity, that
“dim silence where all lovers lose themselves”; when he
assures us that, “stripped of its very life,” the soul is destined
to “sail the wild billows of that Sea Divine,” surely he effects
a true change in our universe. So, too, the wonderful series
of formless visions—though “vision” is a poor word for
intuitive experience of this sort—experienced by Angela of
Foligno, far exceed in their suggestive power her vividly
pictured conversations with Christ, when she declares that
she beheld “those eyes and that face so gracious and so
pleasing.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I beheld,” she says of her ultimate experience of the
Absolute, “a Thing, as fixed and stable as it was indescribable;
and more than this I cannot say, save what I have
often said already, namely, that it was all good. And though
my soul beheld not love, yet when it saw that ineffable Thing
it was itself filled with unutterable joy, and it was taken out
of the state it was in, and placed in this great and ineffable
state.... But if thou seekest to know that which I beheld,
I can tell thee nothing, save that I beheld a Fullness and a
Clearness, and felt them within me so abundantly that I
cannot describe it, nor give any image thereof: for what I
beheld was not bodily, but as though it were in heaven.
Thus I beheld a beauty so great that I can say nothing of it
save that I saw the Supreme Beauty, which contains in itself
all goodness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In the end, all that Angela has said here is, “Come and
see!” but in saying this, she tells us far more than many do
who go about to measure the City of Contemplation. Here
words suggest, they do not tell; entice, but do not describe.
Reminding us of the solemn declaration of Thomas à Kempis,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>that “there is a distance incomparable between those things
that imperfect men think, and those that men illumined by
high revelation behold,” they yet extend to other minds a
musical invitation to intercourse with new orders of reality.</p>

<p class='c005'>This sort of language, this form of paradoxical, suggestive,
allusive art is a permanent feature in mystical literature.
It is usually supposed to be derived through Dionysius the
Areopagite from the Platonists, but is really far older than
this. As it comes down the centuries, it develops in depth
and richness. Each successive mystic takes up the imagery
of negation where the last one leaves it—takes it, because he
recognizes that it describes a country where he too has been—and
adds to it the products of his own most secret and
august experiences. As in the torch-race of the antique
world, the illuminating symbol, once lit, is snatched from
hand to hand, and burns ever brighter as it is passed on.</p>

<p class='c005'>I take one example of this out of many. Nearly all the
great mystics of the later Middle Ages speak of the Wilderness
or Desert of Deity; suggesting thus that sense of great,
swept spaces, “beyond the polar circle of the mind”—of a
plane of experience destitute of all the homely furniture of
thought—which seems to characterize a certain high type,
or stage, of contemplation. It represents the emergence of
the self into a real universe—a “place beyond uttermost place”—unrelated
to the categories of thought, and is substantially
the same experience which Dionysius the Areopagite and those
mystics who follow him call the Divine Ignorance or the Dark,
and which his English interpreter names the Cloud of Unknowing,
where the soul feels itself to be lost. But each mystic
who uses this traditional image of amazement—really the
description of a psychological situation, not of an objective
reality—gives to it a characteristic touch; each has passed
it through the furnace of his own passionate imagination, and
slightly modified its temper and its form. This place, or state,
says Eckhart, is “a still wilderness where no one is at home.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>It is “the quiet desert of the Godhead,” says Tauler; “So
still, so mysterious, so desolate! The great wastes to be
found in it have neither image, form, nor condition.” Yet,
says Richard Rolle—suddenly bringing the positive experience
of the contemplative heart to the rescue of the baffled
contemplative mind—in this same wilderness consciousness
<i>does</i> set up an ineffable correspondence with Reality.</p>

<p class='c005'>“[There] speaks the loved to the heart of the lover; as it
were a bashful lover, that his sweetheart before men entreats
not, nor friendly-wise but commonly and as a stranger kisses ...
and anon comes heavenly joy, marvellously making
merry melody.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Here the mystic, with an astonishing boldness, weaves
together spatial, personal and musical imagery, positive and
negative experience, in order to produce his full effect.</p>

<p class='c005'>Finally, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John of the Cross, great thinker, manly and heroic
mystic, and true poet, effects a perfect synthesis of these
positive and negative experiences—that apparent self-loss in
empty spaces which is also, mysteriously, an encounter of love.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The soul in dim contemplation (he says) is like a man who
sees something for the first time, the like of which he has
never seen before ... hence it feels like one who is placed in
a wild and vast solitude where no human being can come; an
immense wilderness without limits. But this wilderness is
the more delicious, sweet and lovely, the more it is wide,
vast and lonely; for where the soul seems most to be lost,
there it is most raised up above all created things.”</p>

<p class='c005'>All this language, as I have said, belongs to the oblique
and paradoxical side of the mystic’s art; and comes to us
from those who are temperamentally inclined to that pure
contemplation which “has no image.” Psychologically
speaking, these mystics are closer to the musician than to any
other type of artist, though they avail themselves when they
wish of material drawn from all the arts. But there is another
kind of mystic, naturally inclined to visualization, who tends
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>to translate his supersensual experience into concrete, pictorial
images; into terms of colour and of form. He uses, in fact,
the methods of the painter, the descriptive writer, sometimes
of the dramatist, rather than those of the musician or the
lyric poet. He is, I think, as a rule much less impressive than
the artist of the illusive kind, and is seldom so successful
in putting us into communion with reality. On the other
hand—and partly because of his more concrete method—he
is the more generally understood. For one person to whom
Plotinus or Ruysbroeck communicates his sublime intuition
of reality, a hundred accept at their face-value, as true
“revelations,” the visions of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Gertrude or <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Teresa.</p>

<p class='c005'>The picture-making proceedings of this type of mystical
artist are of two kinds. Sometimes they are involuntary,
sometimes deliberate. Often we find both forms in the
same individual; for instance, in Mechthild of Magdeburg
and in Suso, where it is sometimes extremely difficult to find
the dividing line between true visionary experience entirely
outside the self’s control, and the intense meditation, or
poetic apprehension of truth, which demands a symbolic
and concrete form for its literary expression. In both cases
an act of artistic creation has taken place; in one below, in
the other above, the normal threshold of consciousness. In
true visionaries, the translation of the supersensual into
sensual terms is uncontrolled by the surface intellect; as it
is indeed in many artists. Without the will or knowledge of
the subject, intuitions are woven up into pictures, cadences,
words; and, by that which psychologists call a psycho-sensorial
automatism, the mystic seems to himself to receive
the message of Reality in a pictorial, verbal, dramatic or
sometimes a musical form—“coming in to his body by the
windows of the wits,” as one old writer has it.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus the rhythmic phrases in which the Eternal Wisdom
speaks to Suso, or the Divine Voice to <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Catherine of Siena,
verge on poetic composition; but poetic composition of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>automatic type, uncontrolled by the mystic’s surface-mind.
Thus, too, the great fluid visions of the prophets, the sharply
definite, often lovely, pictures which surge up before the mind
of Suso, the Mechthilds, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Gertrude, Angela of Foligno, of
the great <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Teresa herself, are symbolic pictures which
represent an actual interior experience, a real contact with the
supersensual; exhibiting the interpretative power inherent
in the mystical imagination. These pictures are seen by the
mystic—sometimes, as he says, within the mind, sometimes
as projections in space—always in sharp definition, lit by that
strong light which is peculiar to visionary states. They are
not produced by any voluntary process of composition, but
loom up, as do the best creations of other artists, from his
deeper mind, bringing with them an intense conviction of
reality. Good instances are the visions which so often occur
at conversion, or mark the transition from one stage of the
mystic way to another: for example, the mystic marriage of
<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Catherine of Siena, or that vision of the Upper School of
True Resignation, which initiated Suso into the “dark night
of the soul.” I believe that we may look on such visions as
allied to dream-states; but in the case of the great mystics
they are the richly significant waking-dreams of creative
genius, not the confused and meaningless dreaming of normal
men. Suso himself makes this comparison, and says that
none but the mystic can distinguish vision from dream. In
character they vary as widely as do the creations of the
painter and the poet. The personal and intimate, the remote
and metaphysical, sides of the spiritual life are richly represented
in them. Sometimes the elements from which they are
built up come from theology, sometimes from history, legend,
nature, or human life. But in every case the “glory of the
lighted mind” shines on them.</p>

<p class='c005'>Often a particularly delicate and gay poetic feeling—a
faëry touch—shows itself in the symbolic pictures by which
these mystics try to represent their encounter with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>spiritual world. Coventry Patmore once spoke of a “sphere
of rapture and dalliance” to which the great contemplatives
are raised; and it is from such a sphere that these seem to
turn back to us, trying, by direct appeals to our sense of joy,
the most stunted of our spiritual faculties, to communicate
their exultant experience of that Kingdom of Reality which
is neither “here” nor “there” but “everywhere.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Music and dancing, birds and flowers, the freshness of a
living, growing world, all simple joyous things, all airy beauties,
are used in the effort to tell us of that vision which Clement
called the privilege of love. When we read these declarations
we feel that it is always spring-time in those gardens of the
soul of which they tell. <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John of the Cross, who described
those spiritual gardens, said that fragrant roses brought
from strange islands grew there—those strange islands which
are the romantic unexplored possibilities of God—and that
water-lilies shine like stars in that roaring torrent of supernal
glory which pours without ceasing through the transfigured
soul. This is high poetry; but sometimes the mystic imagination
shows itself under simpler, more endearing forms, as
when <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Mechthild of Hackeborn saw the prayers of her
sisters flying up like larks into the presence of God; some
soaring as high as His countenance and some falling down to
rest upon His heart. An angel carried the little, fluttering
prayers which were not strong enough to rise of themselves.
Imagery less charming than this has gone to the making of
many a successful poem.</p>

<p class='c005'>Between the sublime intensity of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John and the crystalline
simplicity of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Mechthild, mystical literature provides us
with examples of almost every type of romantic and symbolic
language; deliberate or involuntary translation of the
heavenly fact into the earthly image. True, the earthly
image is transfused by a new light, radiant with a new colour,
has been lifted into a new atmosphere; and thus has often a
suggestive quality far in excess of its symbolic appropriateness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>In their search for such images the mystics explore
the resources of all the arts. In particular, music and dancing—joyous
harmony, unceasing measured movement—have
seemed to them specially significant <i>media</i> whereby to express
their intuitions of Eternal Life. <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Francis, and after him
Richard Rolle, heard celestial melodies; Kabir, the “Unstruck
Music of the Infinite.” Dante saw the saints dancing in the
sphere of the sun; Suso heard the music of the angels, and
was invited to join in their song and dance. It was not, he
says, like the dancing of this world, but was like a celestial
ebb and flow within that incomprehensible Abyss which is
the secret being of the Deity. There is no need to dwell upon
the remarkable way in which mystics of all countries and
periods, from Plotinus to Jacob Boehme, resort to the dance
as an image of the glad harmonious movements of liberated
souls. I will take two characteristic examples, from the
East and from the West. The first is a poem by Kabir:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Dance, my heart! dance to-day with joy.</div>
      <div class='line'>The strains of love fill the days and the nights with music, and the world is listening to its melodies;</div>
      <div class='line'>Mad with joy, life and death dance to the rhythm of this music. The hills and the sea and the earth dance. The world of man dances in laughter and tears....</div>
      <div class='line'>Behold! my heart dances in the delight of a hundred arts, and the Creator is well pleased.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The next is the German mystic and poetess, Mechthild of
Magdeburg, whose writings are amongst the finest products
of mystical genius of the romantic and emotional type. This
Mechthild’s book, <i>The Book of the Flowing Light of the Godhead</i>,
is a collection of visions, revelations, thoughts and letters,
written in alternate prose and verse. The variety of its
contents includes the most practical advice on daily conduct,
the most sublime descriptions of high mystical experience.
Mechthild was an artist, who was evidently familiar with
the literary tradition and most of the literary expedients of
her time. She uses many of them in the attempt to impart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>to others that vision of Life, Light and Love which she knew.
I take, as an example of her genius, and a last specimen of
the mystic’s creative art, the celebrated letter addressed to
a fellow-pilgrim on that spiritual “Love-path” which she
trod herself with so great a fortitude. It represents not only
the rich variety of Mechthild’s literary resources, but also
those several forms of artistic expression which the great
mystics have employed. Here, concrete representation is
perpetually reinforced by oblique suggestion; the imagery
of the poet is double-edged, evoking moods as well as ideas.
We observe that it opens with a spiritual love-scene, closely
related in style to the secular and romantic literature of
Mechthild’s time; that this develops to a dramatic dialogue
between soul and senses—another common artifice of the
mediæval author—and this again leads by a perfectly natural
transition to the soul’s great acclamation of its destiny, and
the crowning announcement of the union of lover and beloved.</p>

<p class='c005'>The movement of this mystical romance, then, like the
movement of ascending consciousness, goes from the concrete
image to the mysterious and sidelong apprehension of imageless
facts. First we have picture, then dialectic, then intuitive
certitude. Here, too, we find both those aspects of experience
which dominate mystical literature: the personal and intimate
encounter of love, and the self-loss of the soul in an
utterly transcendent Absolute. Surely the union of these
“completing opposites” in one work of art must rank as a
great imaginative achievement.</p>

<p class='c005'>Mechthild tells her story of the soul’s adventure in snatches
of freely-rhymed verse, linked together by prose narrative
passages—a form which is not uncommon in the secular
literature of the Middle Ages.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c009'><sup>[1]</sup></a> We are further reminded of
that secular literature by the imagery which she employs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>The soul is described as a maiden, the Divine Lover is a fair
youth whom she desires. The very setting of the story is
just such a fairy landscape as we find in the lays and romances
of chivalry; it has something of the spring-like charm that we
feel in <i>Aucassin and Nicolette</i>—the dewy morning, the bird-haunted
forest, the song and dance. It is, in fact, a love
story of the period adapted with extraordinary boldness to
the purposes of mystical experience.</p>

<p class='c005'>When the virgin soul, says Mechthild at the opening of
her tale, has endured all the trials of mystical purification,
she is very weary, and cries to her Love, saying, “Oh, beautiful
youth! I long for thee. Where shall I find thee?”
Then the Divine Youth answers:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A gentle voice I hear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Something of love sounds there:</div>
      <div class='line'>I have wooed her long and long,</div>
      <div class='line'>Yet not till now have I heard that song.</div>
      <div class='line'>It moveth me so,</div>
      <div class='line'>Towards her I must go.</div>
      <div class='line'>She is the soul who with pain is torn,</div>
      <div class='line'>And love, that is one with the pain.</div>
      <div class='line'>In the early dew of the morn,</div>
      <div class='line'>In the hidden depths, which are far below,</div>
      <div class='line'>The life of the soul is born.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Then her vassals, which are the five senses, say to the soul,
“Lady, adorn thyself.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“We have heard the whisper clear;</div>
      <div class='line'>The Prince is coming towards thee here,</div>
      <div class='line'>In the morning dew, in the bird’s song.</div>
      <div class='line'>Ah, fair Bride, tarry not long!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>So the soul adorns herself with the virtues, and goes out
into the forest: and the forest, says Mechthild, is the company
of the saints. Sweet nightingales sing there night and day
of true union with God, and there in the thicket are heard the
voices of the birds of holy wisdom. But the youth himself
comes not to her. He sends messengers to the intent that she
may dance: one by one he sends her the faith of Abraham,
the aspirations of the Prophets, the pure humility of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Lady Saint Mary, all the virtues of Christ, and all the sanctity
of His elect; and thus there is prepared a most noble dance.
And then comes the youth and says to the soul, “Maiden,
as gladly shouldst thou have danced, as mine elect have
danced.” But she replies:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Unless thou lead me, Lord, I cannot dance;</div>
      <div class='line'>Would’st thou have me leap and spring,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thou thyself, dear Lord, must sing,</div>
      <div class='line'>So shall I spring into thy love,</div>
      <div class='line'>From thy love to understanding,</div>
      <div class='line'>From understanding to delight.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then, soaring human thought far, far above,</div>
      <div class='line'>There circling will I dwell, and taste encircling love.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>So sings the Bride; and so the youth must sing, that she
may dance. Then says he:</p>

<p class='c005'>“Maiden, thy dance of praise was well performed. Now
thou shalt have thy will of the Virgin’s Son, for thou art
weary. Come at midday to the shady fountain, to the
resting-place of love: and with him thou shalt find refreshment.”</p>

<p class='c005'>And the maiden replies:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh Lord, it is too high, too great,</div>
      <div class='line'>That she should be thy chosen mate,</div>
      <div class='line'>Within whose heart no love can be</div>
      <div class='line'>Till she is quickened, Lord, by thee.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>By this romantic, story-telling method Mechthild has
appealed to the fancy and emotion of the reader, and has
enticed him into the heart of the spiritual situation. Next,
she passes to her intellectual appeal; the argument between
the soul and the senses. From this she proceeds, by a transition
which seems to be free and natural, yet is the outcome
of consummate art, to the supreme declarations of the deified
spirit “at home with the Lord,” as <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul said.</p>

<p class='c005'>The dialogue moves by the process of reduction to a
demonstration of God as the only satisfaction of the questing
soul which has surrendered to the incantations of Reality.
One after another, substitutes for the First and Only Fair are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>offered and rejected. The soul says to the senses, which are
her vassals: “Now I am for a while weary of the dance.
Give place! for I would go where I may refresh myself.”
Then say the senses to the soul: “Lady, wilt thou refresh
thyself in the tears of love of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Mary Magdalene? This
may well satisfy thee?” But the soul says: “Hush, sirs,
you know not what I mean! Let me be, for I would drink
a little of the unmingled wine.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Then say the senses:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh Bride, in virgin chastity,</div>
      <div class='line'>Is the Love of God made ready for thee.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>And the soul says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Even so; yet though high and pure it be,</div>

<p class='c008'>This is the end of all mysticism. It is the term to which
all the artistic efforts of the mystics have striven to lead the
hearts of other men.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>
  <h2 id='chap05' class='c004'>THE EDUCATION OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'>The old mystics were fond of saying that “Man is a made
trinity, like to the unmade Blessed Trinity.” That particular
form of words comes to us from Julian of Norwich; but it
expresses a thought which we often meet in the spiritual
writers of the Middle Ages. Further, these writers were
disposed to find in man’s nature a reflection of the three
special characters which theology attributes to the Christian
Godhead. They thought that the power of the Father had
its image in the physical nature of man: the wisdom of the
Son in his reason: the creative vigour of the Holy Spirit in
his soul. Some taught also that each of these three aspects
of humanity corresponded with one aspect of the triune
reality of the universe: the physical world of nature, the
mental world of idea, the ultimate world of spirit. The
sceptic of course would express this differently, and see in
it but one more illustration of the fact that man always makes
God in his own image. But without scepticism I think we
may explain it thus: that those who have pondered most
deeply on the Divine Nature have most easily found in its
richness, and have best understood, just those attributes
which are most clearly marked in human nature. Man has
inevitably been for them a key to God.</p>

<p class='c005'>These speculations seem at first sight to have little bearing
upon the problems of education. But they are in reality
intimately connected with it: for their consideration leads
us back to the central fact out of which they have arisen—namely,
the abiding truth that man’s deepest exploration of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>own nature gives again and again this threefold result, that he
feels that his real self-hood and real possibilities are not wholly
exhausted by the terms “body” and “mind.” He knows in
his best moments another vivid aspect of his being, as strong
as these, though often kept below the threshold of his consciousness:
the spirit, which informs, yet is distinct from
both his body and his mind.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now the question which all serious educationalists are
called upon to ask themselves is this: To what extent does
that three-fold analysis of human personality influence our
educational schemes? The object of education is to bring
out the best and highest powers of the thing educated. Do
we, in our education, even attempt to bring out the best and
highest powers of the spirit, as we seek to develop those
of the body and the mind?</p>

<p class='c005'>The child as he comes to us is a bundle of physical, mental,
and spiritual possibilities. He is related to three distinct yet
interpenetrating worlds; all accessible to him, since he is
human, and all offering endless opportunities of adventure to
him.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Heaven lies about us in our infancy,</div>
      <div class='line'>Shades of the prison-house begin to close</div>
      <div class='line'>About the growing boy.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Why should they close; whose fault is it that they do? Does
not the fault lie with the poor and grovelling outlook of those
to whom this sensitive, plastic thing is confided? Who so
badly select and manipulate the bundle of possibilities offered
to them, that they often contrive to manufacture a creature
ruled by its own physical needs and appetites, its mental and
emotional limitations; instead of a free, immortal being,
master of its own body and mind. Here is this child, the
germ of the future. To a great extent, we can control the
way that germ develops; the special characters of the past
which it shall transmit. We can have a hand in the shaping
of the history that is to be when we have gone: for who can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>doubt that the controlling factor of history is the physical,
mental, or spiritual character of those races that dominate
the world? It is in the interplay, tension, and strife of these
three universes that history in the last resort consists.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now, on the eve of a new era, is it not worth while to
remind ourselves of this terrific fact? To see whether our
plans are so laid as to bring out all the balanced possibilities
of the coming man; all his latent powers? We recognize
the fact that body and mind must be trained whilst still in a
plastic state. We are awake to the results of allowing them
to atrophy. Where we find individuals with special powers
in one of these directions, we aim at their perfect development;
at the production of the athlete, scholar, man of
action. But it cannot be said that we are equally on the lookout
for special qualities of spirit; that when found, we train
them with the same skill and care. Yet if we do not, can we
expect to get the very best out of the race? To explore all
its potentialities; some, perhaps, still unguessed? We know
that the child’s reactions to life will be determined by the
mental furniture with which he is equipped. His perceptions,
his choice from among the welter of possible impressions
surrounding him, will depend on the character of his “apperceiving
mass.” Surely then it is our first duty so to equip
him that he shall be able to lay hold on those intimations of
spirit which are woven into the texture of our sensual universe;
to lead him into that mood of receptivity in which the beautiful
and the significant, the good and the true, stand out for
him from the scene of life and hold his interest. A meadow
which to one boy is merely a possible cricket field, to another is
a place of romance and adventure, full of friendly life.</p>

<p class='c005'>The mischief is that whatever our theoretic beliefs, we do not
in practice really regard spirit as the chief element of our being;
the chief object of our educational care. Our notions about it
are shadowy, and have very little influence on our educational
schemes. Were it present to us as a vivid reality, we should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>surely provide our young people with a reasoned philosophy
of life in which it is given its place: something which can
provide honest answers to the questions of the awakening
intelligence, and withstand the hostile criticism which wrecks
so much adolescent faith. For ten parents who study the
Montessori system of sense training, how many think of
consulting those old specialists who taught how the powers
of the spirit may be developed and disciplined, and given
their true place in human life? How many educationalists
realize that prayer, as taught to children, may and should
be an exercise which gently develops a whole side of human
consciousness that might otherwise be dormant; places it
in communication with a real and valid universe awaiting
the apprehension of man? How many give the subject the
same close, skilled attention that they give, say, to Latin
grammar on one hand or physical culture on the other? Those
subjects, and many more, have emerged from vagueness into
clarity because attention, the cutting point of the human
will, has been concentrated upon them. Gradually in these
departments an ordered world has been made, and the child
or young person put in correspondence with that world.
We cannot say that the same has been done for the world of
spirit. The majority of the “well-educated” probably pass
through life without any knowledge of the science of prayer,
with at best the vaguest notions of the hygiene of the soul.
Often our religious teachers are themselves no better instructed,
and seem unable to offer the growing and hungry
spirit any food more heavenly than practical ethics and
dogmatic beliefs. Thus a complete world of experience is
habitually ignored by us, and one great power of the human
trinity allowed to atrophy.</p>

<p class='c005'>We are just beginning as educators to pay ordered attention
to that fringe-world in which sense, intellect, and spirit all
have a part: I mean the world of æsthetic apprehension.
It cannot be denied that the result has been, for many of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>young people now growing up, an immense enlargement and
enrichment of life. Look at one of the most striking
intellectual characteristics of the last few years: the rapid
growth of the taste and need for poetry, the amount of it
that is written, the way in which it seems to supply a
necessary outlet for young Englishmen in the present day.
Look at the mass of verse which was composed, under conditions
of utmost horror, on the battlefields; poetry the most
pathetic in the world, in which we see the passionate effort
of spirit to find adjustment, its assertion of unconquerable
power, even in the teeth of this overwhelming manifestation
of brute force. There is the power of the future: the spirit
of beauty and truth seeking for utterance. There is that
quickening spring, bubbling up afresh in every generation;
and ready, if we will help it to find expression, to transfigure
our human life.</p>

<p class='c005'>There is a common idea that the spiritual life means something
pious and mawkish: not very desirable in girls, and most
objectionable in boys. It is strange that this notion, which
both the Jewish and Christian Scriptures so emphatically
contradict, should ever have grown up amongst us. The
spirit, says <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul, is not a spirit of fearfulness; it is “a
spirit of Power and Love and Discipline”—qualities that
make for vigour and manliness of the best type. It is the
very source of our energies, both natural and supernatural.
The mystics sometimes called it our “life-giving life,” and
modern psychologists are beginning to discover that it is,
in the most literal sense, our “health’s eternal spring.”
People say, “Come, Holy Spirit”; as if it were something
foreign to us: yet it comes perpetually in every baby born
into the world, for each new human life entering the temporal
order implies a new influx or, least, a new manifestation of
spirit. But, when spirit is thus wedded to mind and body
to form human nature, it is submitted to the law governing
human nature: the law of freedom. It is ours, to develop
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>or stunt as we please. Its mighty powers are not pressed on
an unwilling race, but given us in germ to deal with as we
will. Parents are responsible for giving it every opportunity
of development, the food, the light, the nurture that all
growing things require—in fact, for its education: a great
honour, and a great responsibility.</p>

<p class='c005'>If we are asked wherein such education should consist, I
think we must reply that its demands are not satisfied by
teaching the child any series of religious doctrines divorced
from practical experience. He is full of energies demanding
expression. Our object is so to train those energies that they
shall attain their full power and right balance; and enable
him to set up relations with the spiritual world in which he
truly lives. The first phase in this education will consist in a
definite moral training, which is like the tilling and preparation
of the earth in which the spiritual plant is to grow: and as
regarding the special objects of this training I will take the
definition of a great spiritual writer, a definition remarkable
for its sanity and moderation: “If we would discover and
know that Kingdom of God which is hidden in us, we must
lead a life that is virtuous within, well ordered without, and
fulfilled with true charity.” What does that imply? It
implies the cultivation of self-control, order, and disinterestedness.
Order is a quality which all spiritual writers hold in
great esteem; for they are far from being the ecstatic, unbalanced,
and mood-ridden creatures of popular fancy. Now
the untrained child has all the disorderly ways, the uncontrolled
and self-interested instincts of the primitive man.
He is a vigorous young animal, reacting promptly and completely
to the stimulus of fear or of greed. The history of
human society, the gradual exchange of license for law, self-interest
for group-interest, spasmodic activity for orderly
diligence must be repeated in him if he is to take his place in
that human society. But if we would also prepare in him the
way of spirit, the aim of this training must be something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>higher than that convenient social morality, that spirit of
fair play, truth, justice, mutual tolerance, which public school
discipline seeks to develop. That morality is relative and
utilitarian. The morality in which alone the life of the spirit
can flourish is absolute and ideal. It is sought, not because
it makes life secure, or promotes the greatest happiness of the
greatest number, but for its own sake. Yet in spite of this,
the social order, in the form in which the child comes in contact
with it, may be made one of the best instruments for
producing those characters demanded by the spiritual life.
For what, after all, is the exchanging of self-interest for
group-interests but the beginning of love? And what is at
the root of the spirit of give and take but humility? See how
the approaches to the spiritual kingdom are found in the midst
of the common life: what easy opportunity we have of
initiating our children into these central virtues of the soul.
The spiritual writers tell us that from love and humility all
other virtues come; that on the moral side nothing else is
required of us. And we, if we train wisely, may lead the young
into them so gently and yet so deeply that their instinctive
attitude to existence will be that of humbleness and love;
and they will be spared the conflict and difficult reformation
of those who wake to spiritual realities in later life.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now humbleness and love, as understood by spiritual
persons, are not passive virtues: they are energetic, and
show themselves in mind, will, and heart. In the mind, by a
constant desirous tendency to, and seeking after, that which
is best; in the will by keenness, or, as the mystics would say,
by diligence and zeal; in the heart, by an easy suppleness of
relation with our fellow men—patience, good temper,
sympathy, generosity. Plainly the moral character which
makes for spirituality is a moral character which also makes
for happiness. Suppose, then, that our moral training has
been directed towards this eager, supple state of humbleness
and love: what special results may we expect as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>personality develops? Spiritual writers tell us to expect
certain qualities, which are traditionally called the “seven
gifts of the spirit”; and if we study the special nature of
these gifts, we see that they are the names of linked characters
or powers, which together work an enhancement and clarification
of the whole personality—a tuning-up of human nature
to fresh levels, a sublimation of its primitive instincts. The
first pair of qualities which are to mark our spiritual humanity
are called Godliness and Fear. By these are meant that
solemn sense of direct relationship with an eternal order, that
gravity and awe, which we ought to feel in the presence of the
mysteries of the universe; the fear of the Lord, which is the
beginning of wisdom. From these grow the gifts called
Knowledge, that is, the power of discerning true from false
values, of choosing a good path through the tangled world,
and Strength, the steady central control of the diverse forces
of the self: perhaps the gift most needed by our distracted
generation. “Through the gift of spiritual strength,” says
Ruysbroeck, “a man transcends all creaturely things and
possesses himself, powerful and free.” This is surely a power
which we should desire for the children of the future, and get
for them if we can.</p>

<p class='c005'>We see that the first four gifts of the spirit will govern the
adjustment of man to his earthly life: that they will immensely
increase the value of his personality in the social order, will
clarify his mind and judgment, confer nobility on his aims.
The last three gifts—those called Counsel, Understanding and
Wisdom—will govern his intercourse with the spiritual order.
By Counsel, the spiritual writers mean that inward voice
which, as the soul matures, urges us to leave the transitory
and seek the eternal: and this not as an act of duty, but as
an act of love. When that voice is obeyed, the result is a
new spiritual Understanding; which, says Ruysbroeck again,
may be “likened to the sunshine, which fills the air with a
simple brightness, and lights all forms and shows the distinctions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>of all colours.” Even so does this spiritual gift
irradiate the whole world with a new splendour, and shows
us secrets that we never guessed before. Poets know flashes
of it, and from it their power proceeds; for it enables its
possessor to behold life truly, that is from the angle of God,
not from the angle of man.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Such an one,” says Ruysbroeck, “walks in heaven, and
beholds and apprehends the height, the length, the depth,
and the breadth, the wisdom and truth, the bounty and
unspeakable generosity, which are in God our Lover without
number and without limit; for all this is Himself. Then that
enlightened man looks down, and beholds himself and all
other men and all creatures; and this gift, through the
knowledge of truth which is given us in its light, establishes
in us a wide-stretching love towards all in common.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“A wide-stretching love towards all in common.” When
we think of this as the ruling character of our future citizens,
and so the ruling character of our future world, we begin to
see that the education of the spirit may represent a political
no less than a transcendental ideal. It alone can bring
about that regeneration, working from the heart outwards,
of which the prophets of every country have dreamed.</p>

<p class='c005'>It seems hard to conceive anything beyond this. But
there is something. To behold things as they are is not the
end: beyond this is that Wisdom which comes not with
observation, but is the fruit of intimate communion with
Reality. Understanding is perception raised to its highest
expression: Wisdom is intuition raised to its highest expression,
and directed towards an absolute objective. It is,
so far as we know here, the crown and goal of human development;
the perfect fruition of love.</p>

<p class='c005'>We have considered very shortly the chief possibilities of
the human spirit, as they are described by those who have
looked most deeply into its secrets. These seers tell us further
that this spirit has its definite course to run, its definite consummation:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>that it emerges within the physical order, grows,
spreads, and at last enters into perfect union or communion
with the real and spiritual world. How much attention do we
pay to this statement, which, if true, is the transcendent fact
of human history, the key to the nature of man? How much
real influence does it have on our hopes and plans for our
children? The so-called phenomenon of conversion—the
fact that so far nearly all the highest and best examples of
the spiritual life have been twice-born types, that they have
had to pass through a terrible crisis, in which their natural
lives were thrown into confusion in order that their spiritual
lives might emerge—all this is really a confession of failure
on the part of human nature: a proof that the plastic creature
has been allowed to harden in the wrong shape. If our
growth were rightly directed, the spirit would emerge and
flower in all its strength and loveliness, as the physical and
mental powers of normal children emerge and flower. What
is wrong with education that it fails to achieve this? Partly,
I think, that the values at which it aims are too often relative
and self-interested; not absolute and disinterested. Its
intelligent gaze is fixed too steadily on earthly society, earthly
happiness. We encourage our young people to do the best
things, but not always from the best motives. We forget the
essential link between work and prayer: yet this alone lifts
man from the position of a busy animal to that of the friend
and helper of God. We forget that our duties ought to include
the awakening of that clear consciousness of eternity which
should be normal in every human being, and without which it
is impossible for any man to grasp the true values and true
proportion of life.</p>

<p class='c005'>From the very beginning, then, we ought to raise the eyes
of the young from the contemplation of the earth under their
feet to that of the heavens above their heads: to give them
absolute values, not utilitarian values, to aim at. There is
nothing morbid or sickly in this: it is rather those who do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>not possess the broader consciousness who are the morbid,
the sickly, and the maimed. The hope of the future is wide.
We must train our children to a wide stretch of faith, of aim,
of imagination, if they are to grasp it, and fully enter into
the inheritance that awaits them.</p>

<p class='c005'>How, then, should we begin this most delicate of all tasks;
this education of the most sacred and subtle aspect of human
nature? We must be careful; for difficulties and dangers
crowd the path, cranks lie in wait at every corner. I have
spoken of the moral preparation. That is always safe and
sure. But there are two other safe ways of approach; the
devotional and æsthetic. These two ways are not alternative,
but complementary. Art, says Hegel, belongs to the highest
sphere of spirit, and is to be placed in respect of its content on
the same footing as religion and philosophy; and many
others—seers and philosophers—have found in the revelation of
beauty an authentic witness to God. But the love and
realization of beauty, without reverence and devotion, soon
degenerates into mere pleasure. So, too, devotion, unless
informed with the spirit of beauty, becomes thin, hard and
sterile. But where these two exist together, we find on one
hand that the developed apprehension which discovers deep
messages in nature, in music, in all the noble rhythms of art,
makes the senses themselves into channels of Spirit: and
this is an apprehension which we can foster and control.
And on the other hand the devotional life, rightly understood
as a vivid, joyful thing—with that disciplining of the attention
and will which is such an important part of it—is the
most direct way to an attainment of that simple and natural
consciousness of our intangible spiritual environment which
all ought to possess, and which the old mystics called by the
beautiful name of the “practice of the Presence of God.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This linking up of the devotional life with the instinct for
beauty and wonder, will check its concentration on the more
sentimental and anthropomorphic aspects of religion; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>so discourage that religious emotionalism which wise educationalists
rightly condemn. Hence these two ways of
approach, merged as they should be into one, can bring the
self into that simple kind of contemplation which is a normal
birthright of every soul, but of which our defective education
deprives so many men and women; who cannot in later life
quicken those faculties which have been left undeveloped in
youth. As logic is a supreme exercise of the mind, so contemplation
is a supreme exercise of the spirit: it represents
the full activity of that intuitional faculty which is our
medium of contact with absolute truth. Before the inevitable
smile appears on the face of the reader, I say at once
that I am not suggesting that we should teach young children
contemplation; though I am sure that many brought up in a
favouring atmosphere naturally practise it long before they
know the meaning of the word. But I do suggest that we
should bring them up in such a way that their developed spirits
might in the end acquire this art, without any more sense of
break with the normal than that which is felt by the developed
mind when it acquires the art of logic.</p>

<p class='c005'>What is contemplation? It is attention to the things of
the spirit: surely no outlandish or alarming practice, foreign
to the general drift of human life. Were we true to our own
beliefs, it should rather be our central and supremely natural
activity; the way in which we turn to the spiritual world, and
pick up the messages it sends to us. That world is always
sending us messages of liberation, of hope, and of peace.
Are we going to deprive our children of this unmeasured
heritage, this extension of life—perhaps the greatest of the
rights of man—or leave their enjoyment of it to some happy
chance? We cannot read the wonderful records of the
spiritually awakened without a sense of the duty that is laid
on us, to develop if we can this spiritual consciousness in the
generation that is to be.</p>

<p class='c005'>All great spiritual literature is full of invitations to a newness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>of life, a great change of direction; which shall at last
give our human faculties a worthy objective and redeem our
consciousness from its present concentration upon unreal
interests. It urges us perpetually, as a practical counsel, as
something which is within human power and has already been
achieved by the heroes of the race, to “put on the new man”;
to “bring to birth the Son of God in the soul.” But humanity
as a whole has never responded to that invitation, and therefore
its greatest possibilities are still latent. We, the guardians
of the future, by furnishing to each emerging consciousness
committed to our care such an apperceiving mass as shall
enable it to discern the messages of reality, may do something
to bring those possibilities into manifestation.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>
  <h2 id='chap06' class='c004'>THE PLACE OF WILL, INTELLECT AND FEELING IN PRAYER</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'>The psychology of religious experience, as yet so little understood,
has few more important problems proposed to it than
that which concerns the true place and right use of will, intellect,
and feeling in prayer. This question, which to some may
appear merely academic, really involves the whole problem
of the method and proportion in which the various powers
and activities of our being may best be used, when they turn
from the natural world of concrete things to attend to the
so-called “supernatural” world of Spirit—in fact, to God,
Who is the source and sum of the reality of that world. That
problem must be of practical interest to every Christian—more,
to every one who believes in the spiritual possibilities
of man—for it concerns itself with all those responses which
are made by human personality to the impact of Infinite Life.
It deals, in Maeterlinck’s words, with “the harshest and most
uninhabitable headlands of the Divine ‘know thyself,’”
and includes in its span the whole region “where the psychology
of man mingles with the psychology of God.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In the first place, what do we mean by prayer? Surely
just this: that part of our active and conscious life which
is deliberately orientated towards, and exclusively responds
to, spiritual reality. The Being of God, Who is that spiritual
reality, we believe to be immanent in all things: “He is
not far from each one of us: for in Him we live, and move,
and have our being.” In fact, as Christians we must believe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>this. Therefore in attending to those visible and concrete
things, we are in a way attending to that immanent God;
and in this sense all honest work is indeed, as the old proverb
says, a sort of prayer. But when we speak of prayer as a
separate act or activity of the self, we mean more than this.
We mean, in fact, as a rule the other aspect of spiritual experience
and communion; in the language of theology, attention
to transcendent rather than to immanent Reality. Prayer,
says Walter Hilton, in terms of which the origin goes back
to the Neoplatonists, “is nothing else but an ascending or
getting up of the desire of the heart into God, by withdrawing
it from all earthly thoughts”—an ascent, says Ruysbroeck,
of the Ladder of Love. In the same spirit William Law
defines it as “the rising of the soul out of the vanity of time
into the riches of eternity.” It entails, then, a going up or
out from our ordinary circle of earthly interests; a cutting
off, so far as we may, of “the torrent of use and wont,” that
we may attend to the changeless Reality which that flux
too often hides. Prayer stretches out the tentacles of our
consciousness not so much towards that Divine Life which
is felt to be enshrined within the striving, changeful world
of things; but rather to that “Eternal truth, true Love, and
loved Eternity” wherein the world is felt to be enshrined;
and in this act it brings to full circle the activities of the human
soul—that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Swinging-wicket set between</div>
      <div class='line'>The Unseen and the Seen.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The whole of man’s life really consists in a series of balanced
responses to this Transcendent-Immanent Reality; because
man lives under two orders, is at once a citizen of Eternity
and of Time. Like a pendulum, his consciousness moves
perpetually—or should move if it be healthy—between God
and his neighbour, between this world and that. The wholeness,
sanity, and balance of his existence will entirely depend
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>upon the perfection of his adjustment to this double situation;
on the steady alternating beat of his outward swing of adoration,
his homeward-turning swing of charity. Now, it is
the outward swing which we are to consider: the powers
that may be used in it, the best way in which these powers
may be employed.</p>

<p class='c005'>First, we observe that those three capacities or faculties
which we have under consideration—the thinking faculty,
the feeling faculty, the willing or acting faculty—practically
cover all the ways in which the self can react to other selves
and other things. From their combination come all the
possibilities of self-expression which are open to man. In
his natural life he needs and uses all of them. Shall he need
and use all of them in his spiritual life too? Christians, I
think, are bound to answer this question in the affirmative.
According to Christianity, it is the whole self which is called
to turn towards Divine Reality—to enter the Kingdom—not
some supposed “spiritual” part thereof. “Thou hast
made us for Thyself,” said Augustine; not, as the Orphic
initiate would have said, “Thou hast made one crumb out
of our complex nature for Thyself, and the rest may go on to
the rubbish heap.” It is the <i>whole man</i> of intellect, of feeling,
and of will, which finds its only true objective in the Christian
God.</p>

<p class='c005'>Surely, the real difference which marks out Christianity
from all other religions lies just here; in this robust acceptance
of humanity in its wholeness, and of life in its completeness,
as something which is susceptible of the Divine. It demands,
and deals with, the whole man, his Titanic energies and warring
instincts; not, as did the antique mysteries, separating and
cultivating some supposed transcendental principle in him,
to the exclusion of all else. Christians believe in a God immanent
and incarnate, Who transfuses the whole of the life which
He has created, and calls that life in its wholeness to union
with Him. If this be so, then <i>Lex credendi, lex orandi</i>; our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>belief should find its fullest expression in our prayer, and that
prayer should take up, and turn towards the spiritual order
all the powers of our mental, emotional, and volitional life.
Prayer should be the highest exercise of these powers; for
here they are directed to the only adequate object of thought,
of love, and of desire. It should, as it were, lift us to the top
of our condition, and represent the fullest flowering of our
consciousness; for here we breathe the air of the supernal
order, and attain according to our measure to that communion
with Reality for which we were made.</p>

<p class='c005'>Prayer so thought of will include, of course, many different
kinds of spiritual work; and also—what is too often forgotten—the
priceless gift of spiritual rest. It will include many
kinds of intercourse with Reality—adoration, petition, meditation,
contemplation—and all the shades and varieties of these
which religious writers have named and classified. As in
the natural order the living creature must feed <i>and</i> grow,
must suffer <i>and</i> enjoy, must get energy from the external
world <i>and</i> give it back again in creative acts, if he would live
a whole and healthy life, so, too, in the spiritual order. All
these things—the giving and the receiving, the work and the
rest—should fall within the circle of prayer.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now, when we do anything consciously and with purpose,
the transition from inaction to action unfolds itself in a certain
order. First we form a concept of that which we shall do;
the idea of it looms up, dimly or distinctly, in the mind. Then,
we feel that we want to do it, or must do it. Then we determine
that we <i>will</i> do it. These phases may follow one another
so swiftly that they seem to us to be fused into one; but
when we analyze the process which lies behind each conscious
act, we find that this is the normal sequence of development.
First we think, then we feel, then we will. This little generalization
must not be pressed too hard; but it is broadly true,
and gives us a starting-point from which to trace out the way
in which the three main powers of the self act in prayer. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>is practically important, as well as psychologically interesting,
to know how they act or should act; as it is practically important
to know, at least in outline, the normal operation of
our bodily powers. Self-knowledge, said Richard of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Victor, is the beginning of the spiritual life; and knowledge
of ones self—too often identified with knowledge of ones
sins—ought to include some slight acquaintance with the
machinery we all have at our disposal. This machinery,
as we see, falls into three divisions; and the perfection of
the work which it does will depend upon the observing of
an order in their operation, a due balance between them,
without excessive development of one power at the expense
of the others.</p>

<p class='c005'>On the side of spiritual experience and activity, such an
excessive and one-sided development often takes place. Where
this exaggeration is in the direction of intellect, the theological
or philosophical mood dominates all other aspects of religion.
Where the purely emotional and instinctive side of the relation
of the soul to God is released from the critical action of the
intelligence, it often degenerates into an objectionable sentimentality,
and may lead to forms of self-indulgence which
are only superficially religious. Where the volitional element
takes command, unchecked by humble love, an arrogant
reliance upon our own powers, a restless determination to do
certain hard things, to attain certain results—a sort of super-sensual
ambition—mars the harmony of the inner life. Any
of these exaggerations must mean loss of balance, loss of wholeness;
and their presence in the active life reflects back to their
presence in the prayerful life, of which outward religion is but
the visible sign. I think, therefore, that we ought to regard
it as a part of our religious education to study the order in
which our faculties should be employed when we turn towards
our spiritual inheritance.</p>

<p class='c005'>Prayer, as a rule—save with those natural or highly trained
contemplatives who live always in the prayerful state, tuned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>up to a perpetual consciousness of spiritual reality—begins,
or should begin, with something which we can only call an
intellectual act; with thinking of what we are going to do.
In saying this, I am not expressing a merely personal opinion.
All those great specialists of the spiritual life who have written
on this subject are here in agreement. “When thou goest
about to pray,” says Walter Hilton, “first make and frame
betwixt thee and God a full purpose and intention; then
begin, and do as well as thou canst.” “Prayer,” says the
writer of the <i>Cloud of Unknowing</i>, “may not goodly be gotten
in beginners or proficients, without thinking coming before.”
All mediæval writers on prayer take it as a matter of course
that “meditation” comes before “orison”; and meditation
is simply the art of thinking steadily and methodically about
spiritual things. So, too, the most modern psychologists
assure us that instinctive emotion does its best work when it
acts in harmony with our reasoning powers.</p>

<p class='c005'><abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Teresa, again, insists passionately on the primal need
of thinking what we are doing when we begin to pray; on
“recollecting the mind,” calling in the scattered thoughts,
and concentrating the intellect upon the business in hand.
It is, in fact, obvious—once we consider the matter in a practical
light—that we must form <i>some</i> conception of the supernal
intercourse which we are going to attempt, and of the parties
to it; though if our prayer be real, that conception will soon
be transcended. The sword of the spirit is about to turn
in a new direction; away from concrete actualities, towards
eternal realities. This change—the greatest of which our
consciousness is capable—must be realized as fully as possible
by the self whose powers of will and love it will call into play.
It seems necessary to insist on this point, because so much is
said now, and no doubt rightly said, about the non-intellectual
and supremely intuitional nature of the spiritual life; with
the result that some people begin to think it their duty to
cultivate a kind of pious imbecility. There is a notion in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>air that when man turns to God he ought to leave his brains
behind him. True, they will soon be left behind of necessity
if man goes far on the road towards that Reality which is
above all reason and all knowledge; for spirit in the swiftness
of its flight to God quickly overpasses these imperfect instruments.
But those whose feet are still firmly planted upon
earth gain nothing by anticipating this moment; they will
not attain to spiritual intuition by the mere annihilation of
their intelligence. We cannot hope to imitate the crystalline
simplicity of the saints; a simplicity which is the result,
not of any deliberate neglect of reason, but of clearest vision,
of intensest trust, of most ardent love—that is, of Faith, Hope,
and Charity in their most perfect expression, fused together
to form a single state of enormous activity. But this is no
reason why we should put imbecility, deliberate vagueness,
or a silly want of logic in the place of their exquisite simpleness;
any more than we should dare to put an unctuous familiarity
in the place of their wonderful intimacy, or a cringing
demeanour in the place of their matchless humility.</p>

<p class='c005'>In saying this—in insisting that the reason has a well-marked
and necessary place in the mechanism of the soul’s approach
to God—I am not advocating a religious intellectualism.
It is true that our perception of all things, even the most
divine, is conditioned by the previous content of our minds:
the “apperceiving mass.” Hence, the more worthy our
thoughts about God, the more worthy our apprehensions of
Him are likely to be. Yet I know that there is in the most
apparently foolish prayer of feeling something warmly human,
and therefore effective; something which in its value for
life far transcends the consecrated sawdust offered up by
devout intellectualism. “By love,” said the old mystic,
“He may be gotten and holden; by thought never.” A
whole world of experience separates the simple little church
mouse saying her rosary, perhaps without much intelligence,
yet with a humble and a loving faith, from the bishop who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>preferred “Oh, Great First Cause” to “Our Father,” because
he thought that it was more in accordance with scientific
truth; and few of us will feel much doubt as to the side on
which the advantage lies. The advantage must always lie
with those “full true sisters,” humility and love; for these
are the essential elements of all successful prayer. But surely
it is a mistake to suppose that these qualities cannot exist
side by side with an active and disciplined intelligence?</p>

<p class='c005'>Prayer, then, begins by an intellectual adjustment. By
thinking of God, or of Spiritual Reality, earnestly and humbly,
and to the exclusion of other objects of thought; by deliberately
surrendering the mind to spiritual things; by preparing
the consciousness for the impact of a new order, the inflow
of new life. But, having thought of God, the self, if it stop
there, is no more in touch with Him than it was before. It
may think as long as it likes, but nothing happens; thought
unhelped by feeling ever remains exterior to its object. We
are brought up short against the fact that the intellect is an
essentially static thing: we cannot think our way along the
royal road which leads to heaven.</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet it is a commonplace of spiritual knowledge that, if
the state of prayer be established, something does happen;
consciousness does somehow travel along that road, the field
of perception is shifted, new contacts are made. How is this
done? A distinguished religious psychologist has answered,
that it is done “by the synthesis of love and will”—that is
to say, by the craving in action which conditions all our essential
deeds—and I know no better answer to suggest.</p>

<p class='c005'>Where the office of thought ends, there the office of will
and feeling begins: “Where intellect must stay without,”
says Ruysbroeck, “these may enter in.” Desire and intention
are the most dynamic of our faculties; they do work. They
are the true explorers of the Infinite, the instruments of our
ascents to God. Reason comes to the foot of the mountain;
it is the industrious will urged by the passionate heart which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>climbs the slope. It is the “blind intent stretching towards
Him,” says the <i>Cloud of Unknowing</i>, “the true lovely will
of the heart,” which succeeds at last; the tense determination,
the effort, the hard work, the definite, eager, humble, outward
thrust of the whole personality towards a Reality which is
felt rather than known. “We are nothing else but wills,”
said <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Augustine. “The will,” said William Law, “maketh
the beginning, the middle, and the end of everything. It is
the only workman in nature, and everything is its work.”
Experience endorses this emphasis on will and desire as the
central facts of our personality, the part of us which is supremely
our own. In turning that will and desire towards Spiritual
Reality, we are doing all that we can of ourselves; are selecting
one out of the sheaf-like tendencies of our complex nature,
and deliberately concentrating upon it our passion and our
power. Also, we are giving consciously, whole-heartedly,
with intention, that with which we are free to deal; and self-donation
is, we know, an essential part of prayer, as of all
true intercourse.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now, intellect and feeling are not wholly ours to give. A
rich mental or emotional life is not possessed of all men; some
are naturally stupid, some temperamentally cold. Even
those who are greatly endowed with the powers of understanding
or of love have not got these powers entirely under
their own control. Both feeling and intellect often insist
on taking their own line with us. Moreover, they fluctuate
from day to day, from hour to hour; they are dependent on
many delicate adjustments. Sometimes we are mentally
dull, sometimes we are emotionally flat: and this happens
more often, perhaps, in regard to spiritual than in regard to
merely human affairs. On such occasions it is notoriously
useless to try to beat ourselves up to a froth: to make ourselves
think more deeply or make ourselves care more intensely.
Did the worth of man’s prayerful life depend on the maintenance
of a constant high level of feeling or understanding, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>were in a parlous case. But, though these often seem to fail
him—and with them all the joy of spiritual intercourse fails
him too—the regnant will remains. Even when his heart
is cold and his mind is dim, the “blind intent stretching to
God” is still possible to him. “Our wills are ours, to make
them Thine.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The Kingdom of Heaven, says the Gospel, is taken by
violence—that is, by effort, by unfaltering courage—not by
cleverness, nor by ecstatic spiritual feelings. The freedom
of the City of God is never earned by a mere limp acquiescence
in those great currents of the transcendent order which bear
life towards its home. The determined fixing of the will upon
Spiritual Reality, and pressing towards that Reality steadily
and without deflection; this is the very centre of the art
of prayer. This is why those splendid psychologists, the
mediæval writers on prayer, told their pupils to “mean only
God,” and not to trouble about anything else; since “He who
has Him has all.” The most theological of thoughts soon
becomes inadequate; the most spiritual of emotions is only
a fair-weather breeze. Let the ship take advantage of it by
all means, but not rely on it. She must be prepared to beat
to windward if she would reach her goal.</p>

<p class='c005'>In proportion to the strength and sincerity of the will,
in fact, so shall be the measure of success in prayer. As the
self pushes out towards Reality, so does Reality rush in on it.
“Grace and the will,” says one of the greatest of living writers
on religion, “rise and fall together.” “Grace” is, of course,
the theological term for that inflow of spiritual vitality which
is the response made by the divine order to the human motions
of adoration, supplication, and love; and according to the
energy and intensity with which our efforts are made—the
degree in which we concentrate our attention upon this high
and difficult business of prayer—will be the amount of new
life that we receive. The efficacy of prayer, therefore, will
be conditioned by the will of the praying self. “Though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>it be so, that prayer be not the cause of grace,” says Hilton,
“nevertheless it is a way or means by which grace freely
given comes into the soul.” Grace presses in upon life perpetually,
and awaits our voluntary appropriation of it. It
is accessible to sincere and loyal endeavour, to “the true
lovely will of the heart,” and to nothing else.</p>

<p class='c005'>So much we have said of will. What place have we left
for the operation of feeling in prayer? It is not easy to disentangle
will and feeling; for in all intense will there is a strong
element of emotion—every volitional act has somewhere at
the back of it a desire—and in all great and energizing passions
there is a pronounced volitional element. The “synthesis
of love and will” is no mere fancy of the psychologist. It
is a compound hard to break down in practice. But I think
we can say generally that the business of feeling is to inflame
the will, to give it intention, gladness, and vividness; to convert
it from a dull determination into an eager, impassioned
desire. It links up thought with action; effects, in psychological
language, the movement of the prayerful self from a
mere state of cognition to a state of conation; converts the
soul from attention to the Transcendent to first-hand adventure
within it. “All thy life now behoveth altogether to stand
in desire,” says the author of the <i>Cloud of Unknowing</i> to the
disciple who has accepted the principle of prayer; and here
he is declaring a psychological necessity rather than a religious
platitude, for all successful action has its origin in emotion
of some kind. Though we choose to imagine that “pure
reason” directs our conduct, in the last resort we always
do a thing because of the feeling that we have about it. Not
necessarily because we like doing it; but because instinctive
feeling of some sort—selfish or unselfish, personal, social,
conventional, sacrificial; the disturbing emotion called the
sense of duty, or the glorious emotion called the passion of
love—is urging us to it. Instinctive emotions, more or less
sublimated; Love, Hatred, Ambition, Fear, Anger, Hunger,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Patriotism, Self-interest; these are the true names of our
reasons for doing things.</p>

<p class='c005'>If this be true of our reactions to the physical world, it
is none the less true of our intercourse with the spiritual world.
The will is moved to seek that intercourse by emotion, by
feeling; never by a merely intellectual conviction. In the
vigour and totality with which the heroes of religion give
themselves to spiritual interests, and in the powers which they
develop, we see the marks of instinctive feeling operating
upon the highest levels. By “a leash of longing,” says the
<i>Cloud of Unknowing</i> again, man is led to be the servant of
God; not by the faultless deductions of dialectic, but by the
mysterious logic of the heart. He is moved most often, perhaps,
by an innate unformulated craving for perfection, or
by the complementary loathing of imperfection—a love of
God, or a hatred of self—by the longing for peace, the miserable
sensations of disillusion, of sin, and of unrest, the heart’s
deep conviction that it needs a changeless object for its love.
Or, if by none of these, then by some other emotional stimulus.</p>

<p class='c005'>A wide range of feeling states—some, it is true, merely
self-seeking, but others high and pure—influence the prayerful
consciousness; but those which are normal and healthy fall
within two groups, one of subjective, the other of objective
emotion. The dominant motive of the subjective group is
the self’s feeling of its own imperfection, helplessness, sinfulness,
and need, over against the Perfect Reality towards
which its prayer is set; a feeling which grows with the growth
of the soul’s spiritual perceptions, and includes all the shaded
emotions of penitence and of humility. “For meekness in
itself is naught else but a true knowing and feeling of a man’s
self as he is.” The objective group of feelings is complementary
to this, and is centred on the goodness, beauty, and
perfection of that Infinite Reality towards which the soul is
stretching itself. Its dominant notes are adoration and love.
Of these two fundamental emotions—humility and love—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>first lies at the back of all prayer of confession and petition,
and is a necessary check upon the arrogant tendencies of the
will. The second is the energizing cause of all adoration:
adoration, the highest exercise of the spirit of man. Prayer,
then, on its emotional side should begin in humble contrition
and flower in loving adoration. Adoring love—not mere
emotional excitement, religious sentimentality or “spiritual
feelings”—but the strong, deep love, industrious, courageous
and self-giving which fuses all the powers of the self into one
single state of enormous intensity; this is the immortal element
of prayer. Thought has done all that it may when it has set
the scene, prepared the ground, adjusted the mind in the
right direction. Will is wanted only whilst there are oppositions
to be transcended, difficult things to be done. It represents
the soul’s effort and struggle to be where it ought to be.
But there are levels of attainment in which the will does not
seem to exist any more as a separate thing. It is caught in
the mighty rhythms of the Divine will, merged in it and surrendered
to it. Instead of its small personal activity, it forms
a part of the great deep action of the Whole. In the higher
degrees of prayer, in fact, will is transmuted into love. We
are reminded of the old story of the phœnix: the active
busy will seems to be burned up and utterly destroyed, but
living love, strong and immortal, springs from the ashes and
the flame. When the reasonable hope and the deliberate
wilful faith in which man’s prayer began are both fulfilled,
this heavenly charity goes on to lose itself upon the heights.</p>

<p class='c005'>Within the normal experience of the ordinary Christian,
love should give two things to prayer; ardour and beauty.
In his prayer, as it were, man swings a censer before the altar
of the Universe. He may put into the thurible all his thoughts
and dreams, all his will and energy. But unless the fire of
love is communicated to that incense, nothing will happen;
there will be no fragrance and no ascending smoke. These
qualities—ardour and beauty—represent two distinct types
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>of feeling, which ought both to find a place in the complete
spiritual life, balancing and completing one another. The
first is in the highest degree intimate and personal; the second
is disinterested and æsthetic.</p>

<p class='c005'>The intimate and personal aspect of spiritual love has
found supreme literary expression in the works of Richard
of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Victor, of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Bernard, of Thomas à Kempis, of our own
Richard Rolle, Hilton, and Julian of Norwich, and many
others. We see it in our own day in its purest form in the
living mystic who wrote <i>The Golden Fountain</i>. Those who
discredit it as “mere religious emotionalism” do so because
they utterly mistake its nature; regarding it, apparently, as
the spiritual equivalent of the poorest and most foolish, rather
than the noblest, most heroic, and least self-seeking, types
of human love. “I find the lark the most wonderful of all
birds,” says the author of <i>The Golden Fountain</i>. “I cannot
listen to his rhapsodies without being inspired (no matter
what I may be in the midst of doing or saying) to throw up
my own love to God. In the soaring insistence of his song
and passion I find the only thing in Nature which so suggests
the high soaring and rapturous flights of the soul. But I am
glad that we surpass the lark in sustaining a far more lengthy
and wonderful flight; and that we sing, not downwards to an
earthly love, but upwards to a heavenly.” Like real human
love, this spiritual passion is poles asunder from every kind
of sentimentality. It is profoundly creative, it is self-giving,
it does not ask for anything in exchange. Although it is the
source of the highest kind of joy—though, as à Kempis says,
the true lover “flies, runs, and rejoices; is free, and cannot
be restrained”—it has yet more kinship with suffering than
with merely agreeable emotions. This is the feeling state,
at once generous and desirous, which most of all enflames the
will and makes it active; this it is which gives ardour and
reality to man’s prayers. “For love is born of God, and
cannot rest save in God, above all created things.”</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>But there is another form of objective emotion besides this
intimate and personal passion of love, which ought to play
an important part in the life of prayer. I mean that exalted
and essentially disinterested type of feeling which expresses
itself in pure adoration, and is closely connected with the sense
of the Beautiful. Surely this, since it represents the fullest
expression of one power in our nature—and that a power
which is persistently stretched out in the direction of the
Ideal—should have a part in our communion with the spiritual,
as well as with the natural world. The Beautiful, says Hegel,
is the spiritual making itself known sensuously. It represents,
then, a direct message to us from the heart of Reality; ministers
to us of more abundant life. Therefore the widening of our
horizon which takes place when we turn in prayer to a greater
world than that which the senses reveal to us, should bring
with it a more poignant vision of loveliness, a more eager
passion for Beauty as well as for Goodness and Truth. When
St. Augustine strove to express the intensity of his regret for
wasted years, it was to his neglect of the Beauty of God that
he went to show the poignancy of his feeling, the immensity
of his loss. “Oh Beauty so old and so new! too late have
I loved thee!”</p>

<p class='c005'>It needs a special training, I think—a special and deliberate
use of our faculties—if we are to avoid this deprivation; and
learn, as an integral part of our communion with Reality,
to lay hold of the loveliness of the First and Only Fair. “I
was caught up to Thee by Thy beauty, but dragged back again
by my own weight,” says Augustine in another place; and
the weight of the soul, he tells us, is its love—the pull of a
misplaced desire. All prayer which is primarily the expression
of our wants rather than our worship, which places the demand
for daily bread before instead of after the hallowing of the
Ineffable Name, will have this dragging-back effect.</p>

<p class='c005'>Now, as the artist’s passion for sensuous beauty finds expression
in his work, and urges him to create beauty as well as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>he can, so too the soul’s passion for spiritual beauty should
find expression in its work; that is to say, in its prayer. A
work of art, says Hegel again, is as much the work of the
Spirit of God as is the beauty of Nature; but in art the
Holy Spirit works through human consciousness. Therefore
man’s prayer ought to be as beautiful as he can make it;
for thus it approaches more nearly to the mind of God. It
should have dignity as well as intimacy, form as well as colour.
More, all those little magic thoughts—those delicate winged
fancies, which seem like birds rejoicing in God’s sight—these,
too, should have their place in it. We find many specimens
of them, as it were stuffed and preserved under glass shades,
in books of devotion. It is true that their charm and radiance
cannot survive this process; the colour now seems crude,
the sheen of the plumage is gone. But once these were the
living, personal, spontaneous expressions of the love and faith—the
inborn poetry—of those from whom they came. Many
a liturgic prayer, which now seems to us impersonal and
official—foreign to us, perhaps, in its language and thought—will
show us, if we have but a little imaginative sympathy,
the ardent mood, the exquisite tact, the unforced dignity, of
the mind which first composed it; and form a standard by
which we may measure our own efforts in this kind.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the beauty which we seek to incorporate into our
spiritual intercourse should not be the dead ceremonious
beauty which comes of mere dependence on tradition. It
should be the freely upspringing lyric beauty which is rooted
in intense personal feeling; the living beauty of a living thing.
Nor need we fear the reproach that here we confuse religion
with poetry. Poetry ever goes like the royal banners before
ascending life; therefore man may safely follow its leadership
in his prayer, which is—or should be—life in its intensest
form. Consider the lilies: those perfect examples of a
measured, harmonious, natural and creative life, under a form
of utmost loveliness. I cannot help thinking that it is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>duty of all Christians to impart something of that flower-like
beauty to their prayer; and only feeling of a special kind will
do it—that humble yet passionate love of the beautiful, which
finds the perfect object of its adoration in God and something
of His fairness in all created things. <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Francis had it strongly,
and certain other of the mystics had it too. In one of his
rapturous meditations, Suso, for whom faith and poetry were—as
they should be—fused in one, calls the Eternal Wisdom
a “sweet and beautiful wild flower.” He recognized that
flowery charm which makes the Gospels fragrant, and is
included in that pattern which Christians are called to
imitate if they can. Now, if this quality is to be manifested
in human life, it must first be sought and actualized, consciously
or unconsciously, in prayer; because it is in the pure,
sharp air of the spiritual order that it lives. It must spring
up from within outwards, must be the reflection of the soul’s
communion with “that Supreme Beauty which containeth
in itself all goodness”; which was revealed to Angela of
Foligno, but which “she could in no wise describe.” The
intellect may, and should, conceive of this Absolute Beauty
as well as it can; the will may—and must—be set on the
attaining of it. But only by intuitive feeling can man hope
to know it, and only by love can he make it his own. The
springs of the truest prayer and of the deepest poetry—twin
expressions of man’s outward-going passion for that Eternity
which is his home—rise very near together in the heart.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>
  <h2 id='chap07' class='c004'>THE MYSTICISM OF PLOTINUS</h2>
</div>
<p class='c003'>In spite of his enormous importance for the history of
Christian philosophy, Plotinus is still one of the least known
and least understood among the great thinkers of the ancient
world. The extreme difficulty of his style, which Porphyry
well described as “dense with thought, and more lavish of
ideas than words,” together with the natural laziness of man,
may perhaps account for this neglect. He was by choice
a thinker, contemplative, and teacher, not a writer. Therefore
the Enneads, which represent merely notes of lectures hastily
and unwillingly written down during the last fifteen years
of his life, offer few inducements to hurried readers. The
fact that he was a “mystic” has been held a further excuse
for failure to understand the more cryptic passages of his
works; though as a matter of fact these are the precipitations
of a singularly clear and logical intellect, and will yield all
their secrets to a sympathetic and industrious attention.
His few translators have often been content to leave difficult
phrases unelucidated, or surrounded by a haze of suggestive
words; and though his splendid and poetic rhapsodies are
quoted again and again, even those later mystics who are
most indebted to him show few signs of first-hand study and
comprehension of his system as a whole. Thanks to this
same obscurity, and the richness, intricacy, and suggestive
quality of his thought, most of his interpreters have tended
to do for him that which he did for his master Plato: they
have re-handled him in the interests of their own religion or
philosophy. Of this, the Cambridge Platonists are the most
notorious example; but the same inclination is seen in modern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>scholars. Thus Baron von Hügel seeks to introduce a dualism
between his mysticism and his metaphysics. Even the brilliant
exposition of his philosophy in the Dean of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul’s <i>Gifford
Lectures</i> is not wholly exempt from this criticism. A comparison
of his analysis with those of Baron von Hügel in <i>Eternal
Life</i>, and of Mr. Whittaker in <i>The Neoplatonists</i> makes plain
the part which temperament has played in each of these
works.</p>

<p class='c005'>Plotinus himself would probably have been astonished
by this charge of obscurity. His teaching had by declaration
two aims. The first was the definitely religious aim of bringing
men to a knowledge of Divine reality; for he had the missionary
ardour inseparable from the saintly type. The second was
the faithful interpretation of Platonic philosophy, especially
the doctrines of Plato, and of his own immediate master,
the unknown Alexandrian Ammonius: for his academic
teaching consisted wholly of a commentary on, and interpretation
of, Plato’s works. His system, therefore, is a synthesis
of practical spirituality and formal philosophy, and will only
be grasped by those who keep this twofold character in mind.
There must always seem to be a conflict between any closed
and self-consistent metaphysical system and the freedom
and richness of the spiritual life: but since few metaphysicians
are mystics, and few mystics are able to take metaphysics
more seriously than the soldier takes the lectures of the armchair
strategist, these two readings of reality are seldom
brought into direct opposition. In Plotinus we have an
almost unique example of the philosopher who is also a practical
mystic; and consequently of a mind that cannot be satisfied
with anything less than an intellectual system which finds
room for the most profound experiences of the spiritual life.
In this peculiarity some scholars have found his principal
merit; others a source of weakness. The position of his
critics has been excellently stated by Baron von Hügel in
<i>Eternal Life</i>. He finds in the Enneads a “ceaseless conflict”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>between “the formal principles of the philosopher” and “the
experiences of a profoundly religious soul.” The philosophy
issues in an utterly transcendent Godhead without qualities,
activity, or being: the mysticism issues in ecstatic union,
actual contact, with a God, “the atmosphere and home of
souls” whose richness is the sum of all affirmations. Yet,
as a matter of fact, this disharmony is only apparent; and is
resolved when we understand the formal character of the
Plotinian dialectic as a “way,” a stepping-stone, the
reduction to terms of reason of some aspects of a reality beyond
reason’s grasp. The discrepancy is like that which exists
between map and landscape. Plotinus, constantly passing
over from argument to vision, speaks sometimes the language
of geography, sometimes that of adventure: yet both, within
their spheres, are true. The Neoplatonic <i>via negativa</i> always
implies an unexpressed because ineffable affirmation. Therefore
its Absolute, of which reason can predicate no qualities,
may yet be the “flower of all beauty” as apprehended by
the contemplative soul.</p>

<p class='c005'>Since the doctrine of Ammonius is unknown to us, we have
no means of gauging the extent to which Plotinus depends on
him: but probably we shall not be far wrong if we attribute
to his influence the peculiar sense of reality, the deep spiritual
inwardness, colour and life, with which his great pupil invests
the dogmas of Platonism. The main elements of the Plotinian
philosophy, however, are undoubtedly Platonic. The Divine
Triad, the precession of spirit and its return to its origin,
the unreal world of sense, the universal soul, the “real”
or intelligible world of the Ideas—these and other ingredients
of his system are a part of the common stock of Platonism.
His originality and his attraction consist in the use which he
makes of them, the colour and atmosphere with which they
are endowed. That which is truly his own is the living vision
which creates from these formulæ a vivid world both actual
and poetic, answering with fresh revelations of reality the
widening demands and apprehensions of the human soul.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>This spiritual world is not merely arrived at by a dialectic
process. It is the world of his own intense experience from
which he speaks to us; using his texts, as Christian mystics
have often used the Bible, to support doctrines inspired by his
personal vision of truth. In spite of his passion for exactitude,
the sharpness and detail of his universe, he is thrown back,
again and again, on the methods of symbol and poetry. We
must always be ready to look past his formal words to the
felt reality which he is struggling to impart; a reality which
is beyond the grasp of reason, and can only be apprehended
by the faculty which he calls spiritual intuition. To this we
owe the richness and suppleness of his system, the absence
of watertight compartments, the intimate relation with life.
Whilst many philosophers have spent their powers on proving
the necessary existence of an unglimpsed universe which
shall satisfy the cravings of the mind, Plotinus spent his in
making a map, based on his own adventures in “that country
which is no mere vision, but a home;” and his apparently
rigid contours and gradients are attempts to tell at least the
characteristics of a living land.</p>

<p class='c005'>Though the Enneads are a storehouse of profound and subtle
thought, the main principles on which their philosophy is
based are simple, and can be expressed briefly. All things,
according to Plotinus, have come forth from the Absolute
Godhead or One, and only fulfil their destiny when they return
to their origin. The real life of the universe consists in this
flux and reflux: the outflow and self-expression of spirit
in matter, the “conversion” or return of spirit to the One.
With the rest of the Neoplatonists, he conceives of the Universe
as an emanation, eternally poured forth from this One, and
diminishing in reality and splendour the further it is removed
from its source. The general position is somewhat like that
given by Dante in the opening of the <i>Paradiso</i>:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“La gloria di colui che tutto move</div>
      <div class='line'>Per l’universo penetra, e resplende</div>
      <div class='line'>In una parte più, e meno altrove,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>though Plotinus would have rejected the spatial implications
of the last line, for to him the One was present everywhere.
The Divine nature is a trinity; but not, as in Christian theology,
of co-equal persons. Its three descending degrees, or hypostases,
are the unconditioned One or the Good—a term which
implies perfection but carries no ethical implications—the
Divine Mind, Spirit, or <i>Nous</i>, and the Soul or Life of the World.
Nothing is real which does not participate in one or other
of these principles. Though the first two hypostases are
roughly parallel to the Eternal Father and Logos-Christ of
Christian Platonism, and some have found in the Plotinian
<i>Psyche</i> a likeness to the immanent Holy Spirit, this superficial
resemblance must not be pressed. Fatherhood cannot
be ascribed to the One save in so far as it is the first cause of
life, for it transcends all our notions of personality. Its real
parallel in Christian theology is that conception of the “Super-essential
Godhead, beyond and above the Trinity of Persons,”
which Eckhart and a few other daring mystics took through
Dionysius the Areopagite from the Neoplatonists. The One
is, in fact, the Absolute as apprehended by a religious soul.
Nor is the Plotinian <i>Nous</i> a person, in any sense in which
orthodox Christianity has understood that term, though it
is called by Plotinus our Father and Companion. Further,
the triadic series does not involve a succession either in
time, or order of generation; but only in value. The worlds
of spirit and of soul are co-eternal with the Absolute, the
inevitable and unceasing expressions of its creative activity.
The utterly transcendent Perfect manifests as Mind or Spirit
(<i>Nous</i>); and this <i>is</i> the world of being. Mind or Spirit manifests
as Life or Soul (<i>Psyche</i>); and this <i>is</i> the reality of the
world of becoming. The lower orders are contained in the
higher, which are everywhere present, though each “remains
in its own place.” “Of all things the governance and existence
are in these three.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Whilst every image of the universe is deceptive, since its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>true nature is beyond our apprehension, Plotinus invites us
to picture the Triad, as Dante did, by concentric circles through
which radiate the energy and splendour of the “flower of all
beauty,” the Transcendent One. “The first act is the act
of the Good, at rest within itself, and the first existence is
the self-contained existence of the Good. But there is also
an act upon it, that of the <i>Nous</i>; which, as it were, lives about
it. And the Soul, outside, circles about the <i>Nous</i>, and by
gazing upon it, seeing into the depths of it, through it sees
God” (<abbr title='one'>I.</abbr> 8. 2). Again, “The One is not a Being, but the
Source of being, which is its first offspring. The One is perfect,
that is, it has nothing, seeks nothing, needs nothing; but as we
may say it overflows, and this overflowing is creative” (<abbr title='five'>V.</abbr>
1. 2). Yet this eternal creative action “beyond spirit, sense,
and life,” involves no self-loss. It is the welling forth of an
unquenchable spring, the eternal fountain of life.</p>

<p class='c005'>As Christian Platonists described the Son as the self-expression
of the Father, so Plotinus describes his second Divine
Principle as the eternal irradiation of the Absolute—<i>il ciel
che più della sua luce prende</i>. This principle he calls <i>Nous</i>;
a word carrying many shades of meaning, which the older
commentators generally rendered as Divine Mind, or Intelligible
Principle. Dean Inge has shown good reason for translating
it as “Spirit,” thus bringing the language of Plotinus
into line with the many later mystics who derive from him.
As a matter of fact, <i>Nous</i> contains both meanings. It is
more spiritual than mind, more intellectual than spirit, in
the sense in which that word is commonly employed. Those
mediæval theologians who made a mystical identification
between the Hebrew conception of the Eternal Wisdom as
we find it described in Proverbs and Ecclesiasticus, and the
Second Person of the Trinity, came very near the Plotinian
concept of <i>Nous</i>, which is at once Intelligence and the intelligible
sphere, Spirit and the spiritual universe; the home of
reality, and object of religious and poetic intuition. It is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>in one aspect, the “Father and Companion” of the soul (<abbr title='five'>V.</abbr>
1. 3), in another “the Intellectual Universe, that sphere
constituted by a Principle wholly unlike what is known as
intelligence in us” (<abbr title='one'>I.</abbr> 8. 2). This is the “Yonder” to which
he so often refers; the “middle heaven” of Indian philosophy,
Ruysbroeck’s “clear-shining world between ourselves and
God.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“... e questo cielo non ha altro dove</div>
      <div class='line'>Che la mente divina,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>says Dante; once more condensing the whole Neoplatonic
vision in one vivid phrase.</p>

<p class='c005'>This rich and suggestive conception of the Second Principle,
as at once King and Creator of the world of life, and also itself
the archetypal world of true values, is the central fact of the
Plotinian philosophy. Its apprehension, he says, is beyond
ordinary human reason, which is fitted for correspondence
with the world of life or soul. It is the function of spiritual
intuition; “a faculty which all possess, though few use.”
Such communion with the world of supernal reality is possible,
because man is potentially an inhabitant of it. “The Fatherland
to us is there, whence we have come: and there is the
Father” (<abbr title='one'>I.</abbr> 6. 8). The “apex” or celestial aspect of our
soul is domiciled there. It “never leaves the Divine Mind;
but, while it clings yonder, allows the lower soul, as it were,
to hang down” (<abbr title='six'>VI.</abbr> 7. 5). Man is, in fact, intermediary
between the two Plotinian worlds of Spirit and Soul, and
participates in both. Eucken, in describing him as the meeting-place
of two orders of reality, is merely restating the
doctrine of the Neoplatonists.</p>

<p class='c005'>As Spirit is the outbirth and manifestation of the One, so
Soul, or Life—the third member of the Triad—is the manifestation
or matter of Spirit; and forms the link between
the physical and the supersensual worlds. Spirit is “at once
its Father and ever-present Companion” (<abbr title='five'>V.</abbr> 1. 3). Soul
is a term covering the whole vital essence (<abbr class='spell'><i>a</i></abbr>) of the world,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>and (<abbr class='spell'><i>b</i></abbr>) of the individual. It has two aspects. The celestial
soul aspires toward, and is in communion with, the spiritual
order; the natural soul hangs down and inspires the physical
order, thereby conferring on it a measure of reality. We are
not, however, to understand by Soul merely the aggregate
of individuals. <i>Psyche</i> is the divine and eternal life of the
created universe, comprehending its infinite variety in a unity
which embraces every object in the sense-known scheme, and
makes it “like one animal” (<abbr title='four'>IV.</abbr> 4. 32). It is:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A motion and a spirit, that impels</div>
      <div class='line'>All thinking things, all objects of all thought,</div>
      <div class='line'>And rolls through all things.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The whole creation, says Plotinus, in one of his great poetic
passages, is “awake and alive at every point.” Each thing
has its own peculiar life in the all; though we, because our
senses cannot discern the life within wood and stone, deny
that life. “Their living is in secret, but they live” (<abbr title='four'>IV.</abbr> 4. 36).
Here we are reminded of the Logos-Christ of the “Sayings”—“Raise
the stone and thou shalt find me: cleave the wood,
and there am I.” By this conception, which is elaborated
from the doctrine of the world-soul in the <i>Timæus</i>, Neoplatonism
bridges the gap between appearance and reality, and also
solves the paradox of multitude in unity. “We do not declare
the Soul to be one in the sense of entirely excluding multiplicity.
This absolute oneness belongs only to the higher
nature. We make it both one and manifold; it has part
in the nature which is divided among bodies, but it has part
also in the indivisible, and so again we find it to be one”
(<abbr title='four'>IV.</abbr> 9. 2).</p>

<p class='c005'>Soul, which has in its highest manifestations many of the
characters of Spirit, is the eternal upholder of the world of
change. “Things have a beginning, and perish when the
soul that leads the chorus-dance of life departs; but the soul
itself is eternal and cannot suffer change ... what the soul
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>is, and what its power, will be more manifestly, more splendidly
evident, if we think how its counsel comprehends and conducts
the heavens; how it communicates itself to all this vast bulk
and ensouls it through all its extension, so that every fragment
lives by the soul entire, which is present everywhere
like the Father which begat it” (<abbr title='five'>V.</abbr> 1. 2). Soul, then, which
is in one sense the reality of the world of becoming and immanent
therein, is also a denizen of eternity, in virtue of its continuity
with and direct dependence on <i>Nous</i>. An unbroken
series of ascending values unites the world of living effort
with the One. It is this which makes the system of Plotinus
a philosophy of infinite adventure and infinite hope.</p>

<p class='c005'>Soul is the lowest of the Divine hypostases. Below it in
the scale of values is the material universe to which its lower
activities give form, slumbering in the rocks and dreaming
in the plants. In plants, says Plotinus, “the more rebellious
and self-willed phase of soul is expressed”: a doctrine which
will find an echo in many a gardener’s heart. The sensible
beauty of the world is the signature of soul, and points to
something “Yonder”; for through loveliness it participates
in the world of spiritual values, and we in apprehending beauty
turn away from matter to <i>Nous</i> (<abbr title='one'>I.</abbr> 8. 4). Matter, as such,
has no reality except as the stuff from which soul weaves up
its outward vesture. Deprived of soul, it is in itself, he says,
“not-being” and “no-thing”: “its very nature is one long
want” (<abbr title='one'>I.</abbr> 8. 5). As a picture is the crude and partial condensation
of an artist’s dream—all that he can force his recalcitrant
material to express—so the physical world is but a
fragmentary manifestation of the great and vivid universe of
soul, and the body is the smallest part of the real man. When
we grasp this, we see how great is the sum of possibilities
opened to us by the Cosmos; how easily the country “Yonder”
can find room for all the visions and intuitions of artists,
poets, and saints.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Plotinian doctrine of man, which became in due course
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>the classical doctrine of Christian mysticism, is the logical
outcome of this cosmology. Man, like the rest of Creation,
has come forth from God and will only find happiness and full
life when his true being is re-united, first with the Divine Mind,
and ultimately with the One. “When the phantasm has
returned to the Original, the journey is achieved” (<abbr title='six'>VI.</abbr> 9. 11).
Hence “our quest is of an End, and not of Ends. That only
can be chosen which is ultimate and noblest, that which calls
to the tenderest longings of the soul” (<abbr title='one'>I.</abbr> 4. 6). As the descending
stages of reality are three, so the stages of the ascent are
three. They are called in the Enneads purification, the work
of reason, which marks the transference of interest from sense
to soul; enlightenment—the work of spiritual intuition—which
lifts life into communion with the eternal world of
spirit; and ecstasy, that profound transfiguration of consciousness
whereby the “spirit in love” achieves union with the
One. These stages are familiar to all students of Christian
asceticism, as the codified “mystic way” of purgation, illumination,
and union: a formula which Dionysius the Areopagite
took from the Neoplatonists. But it is important to
remember that in Plotinus this “way” is not—as it sometimes
becomes in mediæval writers—a rigid series of mutually exclusive
psychological states, separated by water-tight bulkheads.
It is rather a diagram by which he seeks to describe one undivided
movement of life; a prolonged effort and adventure,
which has for its object a deeper and deeper penetration into
Reality, the achievement of a true scale of values, in order
that the real proportions of existence may be grasped. In this
movement nothing is left behind; but everything is carried
up into a higher synthesis, as the latent possibilities of humanity
are gradually realized, and man grows up into eternal life.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Since your soul is so exalted a power, so divine, be confident
that in virtue of its possession you are close to God.
Begin therefore with the help of this principle to make your
way to Him. You have not far to go: there is not much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>between. Lay hold of that which is more divine than this
god-like thing; lay hold of that apex of the soul which borders
on the Supreme (<i>Nous</i>), from which the soul immediately
derives” (<abbr title='five'>V.</abbr> 1. 3).</p>

<p class='c005'>All practical mysticism is at bottom a process of transcendence,
“passing on the upward way all that is other than God”
(<abbr title='one'>I.</abbr> 6. 7): and this process, in different temperaments, assumes
different forms. Since Plotinus united in his own person
the characteristics of the metaphysician, the poet and the
saint, he tends to present it under three aspects; as the logical
outcome of a reasoned philosophy, as a moral purification
which strips us of all unreality, and as a progressive initiation
into beauty. “Beholding this Being, the Conductor of all
existence, the self-intent that ever gives and never takes,
resting rapt in the vision and possession of so lofty a loveliness,
what beauty can the soul then lack? For this, the beauty
supreme, the absolute and the primal, fashions its lovers to
beauty and makes them also worthy of love. And for this
the sternest and uttermost combat is set before these souls; all
our labour is for this, lest we be left without part in this noblest
vision, which to attain is to be blessed in the blissful sight,
which to fail of is to fail utterly” (<abbr title='one'>I.</abbr> 6. 7). In the high place
which he gives to the category of beauty, which is to him one
of the three final attributes of God, the strongly poetic character
of his vision of Reality becomes evident. He anticipates
Hegel in regarding natural beauty as the sensuous manifestation
of spirit and signature of the world-soul “fragment as
it were of the Primal Beauty, making beautiful to the fullness
of their capacity whatsoever it grasps and moulds” (<abbr title='one'>I.</abbr> 6. 6):
and those lovers, artists, and musicians who can apprehend it
have already made the first step towards the inner vision of
the One. Therefore the harsh other-worldliness which made
some mediæval ascetics turn from visible loveliness as a snare,
would have seemed blasphemy to Plotinus, who would certainly
have argued with <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Augustine that “there is no health
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>in those who find fault with any part of Thy creation” (<i>Conf.</i>
<abbr title='seven'>vii.</abbr> 14). On the contrary, his doctrine gives a religious sanction
and a philosophic explanation to those special experiences
and apprehensions of artists, poets, and so-called “nature-mystics”—known
to many normal persons in moments of
exaltation—when</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The world is so charged with the grandeur of God</div>
      <div class='line'>It must shine out, like shining from shook foil.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In such hours, he would say, we perceive through matter
the inhabiting <i>Psyche</i>, and by it reach out to communion
with <i>Nous</i>, for “this is how the material becomes beautiful;
by participating in the thought which flows from the Divine”
(<abbr title='one'>I.</abbr> 6. 2). He would have understood Blake’s claim to see
the universe as “a world of imagination and vision,” and
accepted Erigena’s great saying, “every visible and invisible
creature is a theophany or appearance of God.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus the whole mystic ascent can be conceived as a movement
through visible beauty to its invisible source, and thence
to “the inaccessible Beauty, dwelling as if in consecrated
precincts apart from the common ways” (<abbr title='one'>I.</abbr> 6. 8). Yet this
progress is not so much a change in our consciousness of the
world and of ourselves, as a shifting of the centre of our being
from sense to soul, from soul to spirit, whereby we come
actually to live at new levels of existence. “For all there
are two stages of the path, according to whether they are
ascending or have already gained the upper sphere. The first
stage is conversion from the lower life: the second—taken
by those who have already reached the Spiritual sphere, as
it were set a footprint there, but must still advance within
that realm—lasts till they reach its extreme summit, the term
attained When the topmost peak of the Spiritual realm is
won” (<abbr title='one'>I.</abbr> 3. 1).</p>

<p class='c005'>The process is both intellectual and moral, since its goal
is the absolute Truth and Beauty no less than the absolute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Good. “Each must become God-like and beautiful who
cares to see God and Beauty” (<abbr title='one'>I.</abbr> 6. 9). It involves deliberate
effort and drastic purification of mind and heart,
“cutting away all that is excessive, straightening all that
is crooked, bringing light to all that is in shadow, labouring
to make all one glow of beauty” (<abbr title='one'>I.</abbr> 6. 9). As “all knowing
comes by likeness” (<abbr title='one'>I.</abbr> 8. 1), we must ourselves have moral
beauty if we would see the “Beauty There.” But whether
this way be conceived under æsthetic or ascetic symbols,
Plotinus is at one with all the mystics in declaring that the
driving force which urges the soul along the pathway to
reality is love. This inspires its labour, supports its stern
purifications, “detaches it from the body and lifts it to the
Intelligible World” (<abbr title='three'>III.</abbr> 6. 5), and gives it at last “the
only eye that sees the mighty Beauty” (<abbr title='one'>I.</abbr> 6. 9). Love means
for him active desire; “the longing for conjunction and
rest.” All shades of spiritual and poetic passion, the graded
meanings of admiration, enthusiasm, and worship, are included
in it. It is “the true magic of the universe”; an
attribute of <i>Nous</i>, and an earnest of real life. “The fullest
life is the fullest love, and the love comes from the celestial
light which streams forth from the Absolute One” (<abbr title='six'>VI.</abbr>
7. 23). It is true that the impersonal nature of the Neo-platonic
One gives no apparent scope to the intimate feeling
which plays so large a part in Christian devotion. But the
reality and warmth of the true mystical passion for the
Absolute—its complete independence of anthropomorphic
conceptions—is strikingly demonstrated by those glowing
passages in which Plotinus allows his overpowering emotion,
“that veritable love, that sharp desire,” to speak; and appeals
to the experience of those fellow-mystics who have attained
the vision of “the splendour yonder, and felt the burning
of the flame of love for that which is there to know; the
passion of the lover resting on the bosom of his love” (<abbr title='six'>VI.</abbr>
9. 4). This passion is the instrument of that ecstasy in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>which he taught that those men who have “wrought themselves
into harmony with the Supreme” may briefly experience
the vision of the ineffable One. In it the spirit is burned
to a white heat, which fuses in one single state the highest
activities of feeling, thought, and will. Though the doctrine
of ecstasy appears in Philo, and could reasonably be deduced
from Plato himself, its treatment by Plotinus, the intense
actuality and poetic fervour of its presentation, are the
obvious results of such personal experiences as Porphyry
describes to us. This ecstasy, according to him—and here
he is supported by the majority of later mystics—is not a
merely passive state, nor does it result in a barren satisfaction.
When, withdrawing from all lesser interests, the
soul passes beyond all contingency “through virtue to the
Divine Mind, through wisdom to the Supreme,” and poises
itself upon God in a simple state of rapt attention, it receives
as a reward of its effort not only the beatific vision of the
Perfect, but also an accession of vitality. At this moment,
says Plotinus, it “has another life” and “knows that the
Supplier of true life is present.” The mystic, or “sage,” is
not a spiritual freak; but the man who has grown up to
the full stature of humanity and united himself with that
Source of life which is “present everywhere, yet absent
except only to those prepared to receive it” (<abbr title='six'>VI.</abbr> 9. 4). Therefore
he alone can be trusted to be fully active; since his
action is not a mere restless striving after the discordant
objects of a scattered attention, but an ordered movement
based on the contemplation of Reality.</p>

<p class='c005'>“We always move round the One. If we did not, we
should be dissolved and no longer exist. But we do not
always look at the One. When we do, we attain the end of
our existence, and our rest; and no longer sing out of tune,
but form a divine chorus round the One” (<abbr title='six'>VI.</abbr> 9. 7).</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet in spite of the majesty and purity of his vision, the
devil’s advocate is not without material for an attack upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>Plotinus. The charge brought by <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Augustine against
“the books of the Platonists” as a whole—and by these he
meant chiefly the Enneads—is well known. He found in
their philosophy no response to the needs of the struggling
and the imperfect. In its complete escape from the standing
religious snare of anthropomorphism, Neoplatonism also
escaped from the grasp of humanity. It left man everything
to do for himself. For the Christian philosophy of divine
incarnation, dramatized in history, and expressed in the
phrase “God so loved the world,” the Neoplatonist substitutes
“So the world loves God.” “No one there,” says
Augustine of their school, “hearkens to Him who calleth,
Come unto Me all ye that labour.” The One is the transcendent
Source and the Magnet of the Universe, the object
and satisfaction of spiritual passion; but not the lover,
helper, or saviour of the soul. It “needs nothing, desires
nothing.” The quality of mercy cannot be ascribed to it.
As a term, it is as attractive and impersonal as a mountain
peak; and the mystic attaining it has something of the
aristocratic self-satisfaction of the successful mountaineer.
The Christian and Sūfi mystics, even when most deeply
influenced by Neoplatonism, have always felt the incompleteness
of this conception. They see the soul’s achievement of
reality as the result of two movements, one human and one
divine: a “mutual attraction.” “God needs me as much
as I need Him,” said Meister Eckhart. “Our natural will,”
said Julian of Norwich, “is to have God, and the good-will
of God is to have us.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I was given,” says Angela of Foligno, “a deep insight
into the humility of God, towards man and all other things.”
“The love of God,” says Ruysbroeck, “is an outpouring
and an indrawing tide.” These statements undoubtedly
represent a normal element in spiritual experience; that
sense of a response, a self-giving on the part of its transcendent
object which—whatever explanation we may choose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>to give of it—is integral to a developed mysticism. Neoplatonism,
considered as a religious philosophy, is impoverished
by its failure to recognize and find a place for
this.</p>

<p class='c005'>Moreover, the so-called social side of religion, so grossly
exaggerated by the amateur theologians of the present day,
certainly receives less than justice from Plotinus; for whom
the “political virtues” are merely preparatory to the spiritual
life, and that spiritual life an exclusive system of self-culture,
having as its final stage a “flight of the alone to the Alone.”
Moral goodness is a form of beauty, and therefore “real”;
but there is no suggestion that goodness as such is dearer to
the Absolute than beauty or truth. The problem of evil is
looked at, but left unsolved: a weakness which Plotinus
shares with most mystical philosophers. Evil, he says, has
no place in the “untroubled blissful life” of the three Divine
Principles. Therefore it is not real, but “a form of non-being”
(<abbr title='one'>I.</abbr> 8. 3): a doctrine which makes an unexpected
reappearance eleven hundred years later in the Revelations
of Julian of Norwich. Since the aim of the “wise man”
is the transcendence of the sense world, there is, moreover,
no adequate recognition of those sins, wrongs, and sufferings
with which that “half-real” world is charged. Though
effort and self-denial have their part in the Plotinian scheme,
that transfiguration of pain which was the greatest achievement
of the Gospel is beyond the scope of his philosophy.
Its remedy for failure and grief is not humble consecration,
but lofty withdrawal to that spiritual sphere where the
divine element of the soul is at home, untroubled by the
conflicts, evils, and chances of life. Even the selfless sorrow
of a father or a patriot is to be transcended. Though in this
his practice was doubtless better than his doctrine—for we
know that he was a good citizen, a beloved teacher, and a
loyal friend—he speaks in a tone of icy contempt of those
who allow themselves to be disturbed by the world’s woe.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>“If the man that has attained felicity meets some turn of
fortune that he would not have chosen, there is not the
slightest lessening of his happiness for that. If there were,
his felicity would be veering or falling from day to day;
<i>the death of a child would bring him down</i>, or the loss of some
trivial possession.... How can he take any great account
of the vacillations of power, or the ruin of his fatherland?
Verily, if he thought any such event a great disaster, or any
disaster at all, he must be of a strange way of thinking”
(<abbr title='one'>I.</abbr> 4. 7).</p>

<p class='c005'>Such a sentence, however we look at it, goes far to justify
the description of the Neoplatonic saint as “a self-sufficient
sage”; and explains the question with which Augustine
turned from the Enneads—“When would those books have
taught me charity?”</p>

<p class='c005'>In spite, however, of this fundamental difference in tone,
the wider our reading the more clearly we must realize the
extent to which the Christian mystics are conscious or unconscious
disciples of Plotinus. That unity of witness which
is one of the most impressive facts in the history of mysticism,
may reasonably be regarded as evidence of the reality of that
world of spiritual values which contemplatives persistently
describe. But on its literary side, this same unity of witness
depends closely upon the fact that these contemplatives,
however widely separated by time and formal creed, were
able to make plain their adventures to other men by means
of conceptions drawn from the Plotinian scheme; which has
proved itself able to rationalize and find room for the deepest
spiritual intuitions of man. It could do this because a great
mystic made it. Hence we find it implied, even where unexpressed,
in many of the masterpieces of later mysticism—both
Christian and Mahomedan—and some knowledge of it
is a necessary clue to the full understanding of these writings.
The Sūfi ’Attar, describing the soul’s arrival in “the Valley
of Unity where it contemplates the naked Godhead,” is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>equally its debtor with the Protestant mystic William Law,
declaring that “everything in temporal nature is descended
out of that which is eternal, and stands as a palpable visible
outbirth of it; so that when we know how to separate the
grossness, death, and darkness of time from it, we find what
it is in its eternal state.” Yet few of the theologians and
contemplatives who owe most to Plotinus had any first-hand
acquaintance with the Enneads. Their influence reached
the mediæval world by two main channels. The first line of
descent is through the works of Victorinus and <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Augustine;
the second through the philosopher Proclus and his mysterious
disciple Dionysius the Areopagite. These lines meet in the
<i>Divina Commedia</i>, which may be regarded in one aspect as
the supreme poetic flower of Neoplatonism.</p>

<p class='c005'>The dramatic life-history and exuberant self-revelations
of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Augustine have obscured the debt which Christian
philosophy owes to that less assertive convert and theologian,
Victorinus. Yet since Augustinian Neoplatonism is
derived from his writings and translations, he is the real link
between Plotinus and the mystics of the Latin Church.
A celebrated man of letters and a professor of rhetoric, he
had been formed by Neoplatonic philosophy; and is said
to have been the author of that Latin translation of the
Enneads, which was chief among those “books of the
Platonists” that provided <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Augustine’s stepping-stones
to faith. The stir, not to say scandal, caused by his conversion—so
vividly described in the “Confessions”—was
justified: for the event was crucial in the history of western
Christianity. After his conversion, which took the form of
a re-interpretation, not an abandonment, of his old beliefs,
he set himself to the creation of a Neoplatonic theology; in
which the Plotinian triad, and doctrine of the soul’s precession
and return to the One, appear almost undisguised.
The One he tries to identify with the transcendent and immutable
Father. “Son” and “Spirit” are to him two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>aspects of <i>Nous</i>; the fount of all substantial existence, and
containing from eternity all things in their archetypal reality.
The Son or Logos is “the Logos of all that is,” ever gushing
forth from the “living fountain” of the Father. It was from
Victorinus that Catholicism obtained the characteristic
Plotinian notions of Deity as “ever active and ever at rest,”
and of the life of reality as consisting in immanence, progress,
and return, which meet us again and again in the writings
of the mystics.</p>

<p class='c005'>It is plain that <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Augustine, in his first Christian period,
was deeply indebted to Plotinus, whom he knew through
Victorinus and frequently quotes by name; calling him “one
of those more excellent philosophers” whose doctrine of the
soul is in harmony with the Prologue of the Fourth Gospel.
When he came to write the “Confessions,” the glamour
of the Platonic vision had begun to fade, and he was able to
deal in a critical spirit with his own brief Plotinian experience
of “that which Is” (<abbr title='seven'>VII.</abbr> 17). Nevertheless, none can
understand that book without some knowledge of the Enneads,
from which all its finest passages are derived, and in more
than one instance—especially Book <abbr title='seven'>VII</abbr> and the celebrated
tenth chapter of Book <abbr title='nine'>IX</abbr>—closely imitated. In Augustine’s
invocation of “the Beauty so old and so new,” in his description
of the “Country which is no vision but a Father-land,”
or of “the Light which never changes, above the
soul, above the intelligence,” we see how closely he had
studied them, the extent to which their language had permeated
his thought. It is, however, in the tracts composed
soon after his conversion—<abbr class='spell'>e.g.</abbr> <i>De Quantitate Animæ</i>, written
about <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 388—that their influence is most strongly marked;
and the ecstatic vision of the One is definitely put forward
as the summit of Christian experience. From this time
onwards, the main outlines of mystical theology were more
or less fixed: and since <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Augustine was one of the most
widely read and deeply reverenced of the Fathers, with an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>authority hardly inferior to that of Scripture itself, its Neoplatonic
colour was never lost. Wherever Christian mysticism
passes from the emotional and empirical to the philosophic,
this colour is clearly seen, and the concepts of Plotinus, more
or less disguised, reappear: even in those mediæval writers
who had no direct acquaintance with Greek philosophy.
The immense popularity of the so-called Dionysian writings,
which derive much of their doctrine through Proclus from
the Enneads, helped to establish yet more firmly the Neoplatonic
character of Christian and also of Sūfi mysticism.
Through these writings the conceptions of the Super-essential
Godhead; of successive spiritual spheres or emanations of
descending splendour, intervening between the Absolute and
the physical world; and of ecstatic union with the transcendent
and unconditioned One as the term of religious experience,
passed over from the ancient to the mediæval world. Translated
from Greek into Syriac in the fifth century, they deeply
affected Sūfi philosophy. They entered Western thought
in the ninth century, through Erigena’s Latin translation.
It is said that by <abbr class='spell'><span class='fss'>A.D.</span></abbr> 850 Dionysius was known from
the Tigris to the Atlantic: and from this time onwards
his influence, and through him that of Plotinus, can be
traced in the spiritual literature of Christianity and
Islam.</p>

<p class='c005'>Erigena, whose original works are strongly coloured by
Neoplatonism, is the first mediæval writer in whom this
influence appears. He follows Plotinus and Dionysius closely
in teaching that the Absolute Godhead is “beyond being”
and therefore transcendent to the trinity of Persons; a
doctrine of doubtful orthodoxy, which was of great importance
in the later development of mysticism. But a
still closer approximation to the thought, and especially to
the psychology of Plotinus, is found in Richard of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Victor:
perhaps the greatest mystical theologian, certainly one of
the most influential writers, of the early Middle Ages. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries his works, which are
now hardly read, circulated through western Europe, and
shaped the developing mysticism of England, Germany, and
Flanders. Dante, who calls him one “who in contemplation
was more than man,” places his radiant soul among those
of the great teachers in the Heaven of the Sun (<i>Par.</i> <abbr title='ten'>X.</abbr> 131).
Abandoning alike the many worlds of Dionysius and the
crude dualism of popular religion, Richard taught that three
spheres are open to human contemplation: <i>sensibilia</i>, <i>intelligibilia</i>,
and <i>intellectibilia</i>—a series closely analogous to
the three worlds of Plotinus. He said that three kinds of
contemplation on man’s part corresponded with these worlds.
These are <i>mentis dilatatio</i>, a widening of the soul’s vision,
which yet remains within the natural order: <i>mentis sublevatio</i>,
an uplifting of the illuminated mind to the apprehension
of “things above itself” (or, as Neoplatonists would
say, intelligibles); and finally <i>mentis alienatio</i> or ecstasy, in
which the soul gazes on Truth in its naked simplicity. Then
“elevated above itself and rapt in ecstasy, it beholds things
in the Divine Light at which all human reason succumbs.”
This divine light is the <i>lumen gloriæ</i>, the radiance of the
spiritual or intelligible world, which transforms the soul and
makes it capable of beholding God; a conception which
became a commonplace of mediæval theology, was adopted
by nearly all the mystics, and plays an important part in
the <i>Paradiso</i>.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Ruysbroeck—a student of Dionysius and of Richard—says
of it in <i>The Twelve Béguines</i>: “From the Face of the Father
there shines a clear light on those souls whose thought is
bare and stripped of images, uplifted above the senses and
above similitudes, beyond and without reason, in high purity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>of spirit. This Light is not God, but it is the mediator between
the seeing thought and God.” These passages and
many like them can be shown to derive directly through
<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Augustine from the Enneads. Thus Plotinus says: “Light
is visible by Light. The <i>Nous</i> sees itself, and this light,
shining on the soul, enlightens it and makes it a member
of the spiritual world” (<abbr title='five'>V.</abbr> 3. 8). Augustine, apparently
referring to this passage among others, says: “Often and in
many places does Plotinus declare, expounding the meaning
of Plato, that what they believe to be the Soul of the World
has its bliss from the same source as ours, namely, a Light
which it is not, but by which it was created, and from whose
spiritual illumination it shines spiritually” (<i>De Civ. Dei.</i> <abbr title='ten'>X.</abbr>
2). And, of his own ecstatic experience, “I entered and
beheld with the mysterious eye of my soul the Light that
never changes, above the eye of my soul, above my intelligence....
He who knows the truth knows that Light,
and he who knows that Light knows Eternity” (<i>Conf.</i> <abbr title='seven'>VII.</abbr>
10).</p>

<p class='c005'>From the thirteenth century onwards, the majority of the
mediæval mystics show knowledge and appreciation of those
Plotinian ideas which reached them—though in an attenuated
form—through <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Augustine, Dionysius, and Richard of
<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Victor. Even the Franciscan and Christo-centric enthusiasm
of such contemplatives as Jacopone da Todi and
Angela of Foligno was affected by these lofty conceptions.
Thus Jacopone takes from the Neoplatonists the three stages
of spiritual experience, and describes in unequivocal language
his successive achievements of that Logos-Christ—so near
the Plotinian <i>Nous</i>—“<i>che de omne bellezze se’ fattore</i>,”
and of the “Imageless Good” who cannot be named. So
too, Angela’s successive visions of the divine fullness and
beauty, and of “the ineffable Thing of which nought
may be said” depend for their expression on the same
philosophy.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Nor was its penetrative influence confined to the mystical
schools. <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Thomas Aquinas, who accepts and expounds
in the <i>Summa</i> (<abbr title='one'>I.</abbr> <abbr class='spell'><i>q.</i></abbr>12. <abbr class='spell'><i>a.</i></abbr>5) the doctrine of the <i>lumen gloriæ</i>,
is considerably indebted to Plotinus in several other particulars;
though he cites him inaccurately, and does not
seem to have known him at first hand. In a remarkable
passage, which afterwards influenced one of the finest rhapsodies
of Ruysbroeck, he has actually “lifted” the most
celebrated phrase in the Sixth Ennead, and adapted it to
the distinctively Christian and non-Platonic view of divine
union, as a “mutual act” of God and the soul. “In a
wonderful and unspeakable manner,” says <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Thomas of
the soul in this place, “she both seizes and is seized upon,
devours and is herself devoured, embraces and is violently
embraced; and by the knot of love she unites herself with
God, and <i>is with Him as the Alone with the Alone</i>.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It is in a later and less orthodox son of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Dominic, the
formidable and adventurous thinker Eckhart, that the influence
of Plotinus on the mediæval mind is best seen: passing
through him to Suso, Tauler, Ruysbroeck, and other mystics
of the fourteenth century. Eckhart’s philosophy still provides
one of the most suggestive glosses upon the Enneads.
He made that distinction between the absolute and supra-personal
Godhead and the God of devotion, which was almost
inevitable for a Christian thinker trying to find a place in
theology for the Neoplatonic One. The Godhead, he says,
is “a non-God, a non-Spirit, a non-person, a non-image:
a sheer pure One.” The Son, in whom “the Father becomes
conscious of Himself,” combines the attributes of the Logos-Christ
with those of the <i>Nous</i>. In Him are the archetypes
of all created things. There is thus an emanation from the
Godhead, through the Son, into creation. The soul’s destiny
is exactly that conceived by Plotinus: it must ascend to the
spiritual world, and through it to its origin, the One, “flowing
back into the bottom of the bottomless fountain from which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>it flowed forth.” In Tauler and Suso, and especially in the
great Flemish contemplative Ruysbroeck, these ideas—though
modified by their inferior speculative ability and more
ardent spirit of Christian devotion—are still strongly felt:
and since their works and those of their disciples nourished
many succeeding generations of contemplatives, through
them the mystical side of the Neoplatonic tradition was
handed down. In Ruysbroeck, with his threefold division
of spiritual experience into “the moral life, the contemplative
life, and the super-essential life,” and his astonishing
and detailed descriptions of the soul’s achievement of the
Essential Unity, the “death into the One through love,”
the vision of Plotinus is fully baptized into the Catholic
Church. In Jacob Boehme, who drew through Schwenkenfeld
and Weigel from Eckhart and his school, the doctrine of the
three worlds which forms the basis of his cosmology contains
distinct reminiscences of the Plotinian Triad. “These
three,” he says, “are nought else than the One God in His
wonderful works ... and we are thus to understand a
threefold Being, or three worlds in one another.” His conception
of the Light-world, source of all spiritual beauty
and home of “the true human essence,” is very near to the
<i>Nous</i>. Yet the very closeness with which all these mystics
follow those parts of the Neoplatonic doctrine which appeal
to them, makes it possible for us to measure the distance
which separates their minds, their tone and temper, from
that of Plotinus and his school. The calm, the austerity of
thought, the emphasis on beauty, the clear cool light of the
Intelligible World have departed. These men see philosophy
through the haze of Christian feeling. Their work is full of
passionate effort; is centred on the ideas of sacrifice and of
pain. Their religion is coloured by the sharp Christian
consciousness of sin, and by the difficulty—never squarely
faced—of reconciling devotion to a personal redeemer with
the mystical passion for the Absolute. That the philosophy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>of the Enneads was able to enter a world so remote from its
spirit, and come to terms with an attitude of mind in many
respects opposed to that of its creator, is an oblique proof of
the authenticity of its claim to interpret the spiritual experiences
of man.</p>

  <h2 id='chap08' class='c004'>THREE MEDIÆVAL MYSTICS</h2>
</div>
<h3 id='chap08-a' class='c010'><abbr title='one'>I</abbr> <br> “THE MIRROR OF SIMPLE SOULS”</h3>
<h4 class='c011'><abbr title='one'>I</abbr></h4>
<p class='c003'><i>The Mirror of Simple Souls</i>—a rare work on the spiritual
life, of which manuscripts exist in the British Museum, the
Bodleian, and one or two other public libraries—has so far
received little or no attention from students of religious
literature. Yet it may turn out to possess great importance,
as one of the missing links in the history of English
mysticism: for it is a middle-English translation, made at
the close of the fourteenth century or beginning of the
fifteenth, of the lost work of a French thirteenth-century
mystic. It shows, therefore, that the common View of
French mediæval religion as unmystical needs qualification;
and further indicates a path by which the contemplative
tradition of western Europe reached England and affected
the development of our native mystical school.</p>

<p class='c005'><i>The Mirror of Simple Souls</i>, as we now have it, is a work
of nearly 60,000 words in length. So far from being simple,
it deals almost exclusively with the rarest and most sublime
aspects of spiritual experience. Its theme is the theme of
all mysticism: the soul’s adventures on its way towards
union with God. It is not, like the <i>Melum</i> of Richard Rolle,
or <i>Revelations</i> of Julian of Norwich, a subjective book; the
record of personal experiences and actual “conversations in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>heaven.” Rather it is objective and didactic, a work of
geography, not a history of travel; an advanced text-book
of the contemplative life. Only from the ardour and exactitude
of its descriptions, its strange air of authority, its defiance
of pious convention, can we gather that it is the fruit
of first-hand experience, not merely of theological study:
though its writer was clearly a trained theologian, familiar
with the works of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Augustine and Dionysius the Areopagite,
whom no mystic of the Middle Ages wholly escaped,
and apparently with those of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Bernard, Hugh and Richard
of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Victor, and other mediæval authorities on the inner
life.</p>

<p class='c005'>I have said that the <i>Mirror</i>, as we have it, purports to
be the translation of an unknown French treatise. This
translation, so far as we can judge from its language, was
probably made in the early years of the fifteenth century,
perhaps at the end of the fourteenth. Its author, then,
lived at the close of the golden age of English mysticism:
he was the contemporary of Julian of Norwich, who was
still living in 1413, and of Walter Hilton, who died in 1395.
Himself a mystic, he was no servile translator; rather the
eager interpreter of the book which he wished to make accessible
to his countrymen. Our manuscripts begin with his
prologue: an ingenuous confession of the difficulties of the
undertaking, his own temerity in daring to touch these “high
divine matters,” his fear lest the book should fall into unsuitable
hands and its more extreme teachings be misunderstood.
It appears from this prologue that our version of
the <i>Mirror</i> is a second, or revised edition; the first having
failed to be comprehensible to its readers.</p>

<p class='c005'>The character of the translator, as disclosed for us in his
prologue, is itself interesting. Clearly he was a contemplative;
and the “high ghostly feelings” of which he treats
are to him the strictly practical objects of supreme desire,
though he modestly disclaims their possession. He appears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>before us as a gentle, humble, rather timid soul: often
frankly terrified by the daring flights of his “French book,”
which he is at pains to explain in a safe sense. One would
judge him, from the peeps which he gives us into his mind, a
disciple of the devout and homely school of Walter Hilton,
rather than a descendant of the group of advanced mystics
which produced in the mid-fourteenth century <i>The Cloud
of Unknowing</i>, <i>The Pistle of Private Counsel</i>, and other
profound studies of the inner life. These books were written
under the strong influence of Dionysius the Areopagite;
whose <i>Mystical Theology</i>, under the title of <i>Dionise Hid
Divinite</i>, was first translated into English by some member
of the school. But to the translator of the <i>Mirror</i> his author’s
drastic applications of the Dionysian paradoxes of indifference,
passivity, and nescience as the path to knowledge
teem with “hard sayings.” His attitude towards them is
that of reverential alarm: he fears their probable effect on
the mind of the hasty reader. They seem, as he says in one
place, “fable or error or hard to understand” until one has
read them several times. He is sure that their real meaning
is unexceptionable; but terribly afraid that they will be
misunderstood.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here, then, is the prologue which sets forth his point of
view.</p>

<p class='c005'>“To the worship and laud of the Trinity be this work
begun and ended! Amen.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This book, the which is called <i>The Mirror of Simple Souls</i>,
I, most unworthy creature and outcast of all other, many
years gone wrote it out of French into English after my
lewd cunning; in hope that by the grace of God it should
profit the devout souls that shall read it. This was forsooth
mine intent. But now I am stirred to labour it again new,
for because I am informed that some words thereof have
been mistaken. Therefore, if God will, I shall declare these
words more openly. For though Love declare the points
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>in the same book, it is but shortly spoken, and may be taken
otherwise than it is meant of them that read it suddenly and
take no further heed. Therefore such words to be twice
opened it would be more of audience [understanding]: and
so by grace of our Lord good God it shall the more profit to
the auditors. But both the first time and now, I have great
dread to do it. For the book is of high divine matters and
high ghostly feelings, and cunningly and full mystically it is
spoken, and I am a creature right wretched and unable to
do any such work: poor and naked of ghostly fruits, darkened
with sins and defaults, environed and wrapped therein oft
times, the which taketh away my taste and my clear sight;
so that little I have of ghostly understanding and less of the
feeling of divine love. Therefore I may say the words of
the prophet: ‘My teeth be nought white to bite of this
bread.’ But Almighty Jesu, God that feedeth the worm and
gives sight to the blind and wit to the unwitty; give me
grace of wit and wisdom in all times wisely to govern myself,
following alway His will, and send me clear sight and true
understanding well to do this work to His worship and
pleasaunce: profit also and increase of grace to ghostly
lovers that be disposed and called to this high election of
the freedom of soul.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He goes on to the difficulty which dogs all writers on
mysticism; the impossibility of making mystic truth seem real
to those who have no experience of the mystic life. It has
been said that only mystics can write about mysticism. It
were truer to say that only mystics can read about it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“Oh ye that shall read this book! do ye as David says
in the Psalter, <i>Gustate et videte</i>: that is to say, ‘Taste and
see.’ But why trow ye he said, taste first, e’er than he said
see? For first a soul must taste, e’er it have very understanding
and true sight; sight of ghostly workings of divine
love. Oh full naked and dark, dry and unsavoury be the
speakings and writings of these high ghostly feelings of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>love of God to them that have not tasted the sweetness
thereof. But when a soul is touched with grace, by which
she has tasted somewhat of the sweetness of this divine
fruition, and begins to wade, and draweth the draughts to
her-ward, then it savours the soul so sweetly that she desires
greatly to have of it more and more, and pursueth thereafter.
And then the soul is glad and joyful to hear and to read of all
thing that pertains to this high feeling of the workings of
divine love, in nourishing and increasing her love and devotion
to the will and pleasing of Him that she loves, God
Christ Jesu. Thus she enters and walks in the way of illumination,
that she might be taught into the ghostly influences
of the divine work of God, there to be drowned in the high
flood, and oned to God by ravishing of love, by which she is
all one spirit with her Spouse. Therefore to these souls that
be disposed to these high feelings Love has made of him this
book in fulfilling of their desire.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But even for those who have been initiated into this
way of illumination, the translator acknowledges that many
things in the <i>Mirror</i> are difficult and obscure: “often
he leaveth the nut and the kernel within the shell unbroken,
that is to say, that Love in this book leaves to souls the touches
of his divine works privily hid under dark speech, for they
should taste the deeper the draughts of his love and drink;
and also to make them have the more clear insight in divine
understandings to divine love, and declare himself.” Therefore
he has added his own explanations to the more difficult
passages. “Where meseems most need I will write more
words thereto in manner of gloss after my simple cunning as
meseems best. And in these few places that I put in more
than I find written I will begin with the first letter of my
name <abbr class='spell'>M.</abbr> and end with this letter <abbr class='spell'>N.</abbr> the first of my surname.”</p>

<p class='c005'>He ends with a gentle complaint of the badness of the text
from which he worked, and the confession that he has allowed
himself a certain amount of editorial liberty. “The French
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>book that I shall write after is evil written, and in some places
for default of words and syllables the reason is away. Also
in translating of French some words need to be changed, or
it will fare ungoodly, not according to the sentence. Wherefore
I will follow the sentence according to the matter, as
near as God will give me grace; obeying me ever to the
correction of Holy Kirk, praying ghostly livers and clerks
that they will vouchsafe to correct and amend there that I
do amiss.”</p>

<p class='c005'>So much for <abbr class='spell'>M.N.</abbr>, the English mystic. The prologue of
the author, which comes next, tells us all that we know
about the anonymous French writer of the book. This
person was of a very different temper from <abbr class='spell'>M.N.</abbr> As a
Catholic scholar has observed of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Teresa, “L’auteur ne se
faisait pas illusion sur le mèrite de son œuvre.” Like Teresa,
he believed himself to have written under immediate divine
inspiration; a fact which somewhat excuses his complacency
in regard to the result. This is a common claim with the
mystics, in whom subconscious cerebration is always exceptionally
active, and whose writings often exhibit an
automatic and involuntary character, seeming to them the
work of another mind. Jacob Boehme, Madame Guyon, and
Blake are obvious cases in point. The author of the <i>Mirror</i>,
however, was anxious that his claim to inspiration should
be endorsed. He therefore—most fortunately for us—sent
his work to various “learned clerks,” persons of importance
in the theological world, and chronicles their appreciatory
remarks in the prologue; which becomes in his hands a form
of mediæval “advance-notice.” It will be observed that
his critics share the opinion of <abbr class='spell'>M.N.</abbr>, that though full of
“ghostly cunning” this is a dangerous work to put into
the hands of the plain man.</p>

<p class='c005'>Of these critics “The first was a Friar Minor of great name,
of life of perfection. Men called him Friar John of Querayne....
He said soothly that this book is made by the Holy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>Ghost. And though all the clerks of the world heard it,
but if they understand it, that is to say, but if they have
high ghostly feelings and this same working, they shall nought
wit what it means. And he prayed for the love of God that
it be wisely kept: and that but few should see it. And he
said thus, that it was so high that himself might not understand
it. And after him a monk of Cisetyns [Citeaux] read
it, that hight Dan Frank, Chantor of the Abbey of Viliers:
and he said that it proved well by the Scripture that it is
all truth that this book says. And after him read it a Master
of Divinity, that hight Master Godfrey of Fountaynes: and
he blamed it nought, no more than did the other. But he
said thus, that he counselled nought [<i>sic</i>] that few should
see it; and for this cause, for they might leave their own
working and follow this calling, to the which they should
never come, and so they might deceive themselves, for it is
made of a spirit so strong and so cutting, that there be but
few such or none.... For the peace of auditors was this
proved, and for your peace we say it to you. For this seed
should bear holy fruit to them that hear it and worthy be.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Of the three persons here mentioned, Friar John and Dan
Frank still remain unidentified: but Godfrey of Fountaynes
is almost certainly the Master of Divinity, called Doctor
Venerandus, who was a prominent member of the University
of Paris at the end of the thirteenth century. He was at
the height of his fame about 1280-1290, and died about 1306.
“<i>Grande lumen studii magister Godefridum de Fontanis</i>,”
he is called in a letter of 1301. In the great war between
Friars and Seculars which divided the University at the end
of the thirteenth century, this Godfrey was one of the bitterest
opponents of the Mendicant Orders. He wrote against them,
and attacked them in the Synod of Paris in 1283. We see
therefore that the author of the <i>Mirror</i>, in placing Godfrey’s
testimonial beside that of Friar John, secured with a cunning
other than ghostly a friend in each of the opposing camps.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>There is, however, one obvious and significant omission
in this list of patrons. There is no name which emanates
directly from the great school of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Thomas Aquinas; supreme
at that moment in the University, and the custodian of orthodox
philosophy. There is, indeed, little trace of scholastic
influence in the <i>Mirror</i>, which is far more in harmony with
the mystical theology favoured by <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Bonaventura, and
continued during the following century in the Franciscan
schools: a fact which explains at once the guarded approbation
of Friar John, and the absence of Dominican patronage.
In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries the Franciscans
were eager students of and commentators on Dionysius the
Areopagite: and the order which produced and upheld the
hardy speculations of Duns Scotus might well look with
indulgence on the most extravagant statements of <i>The
Mirror of Simple Souls</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>The original version of this book, then, was probably written
in the last quarter of the thirteenth century, and certainly
before 1306. Its writer was therefore the contemporary
of Eckhart and Jacopone da Todi, the great mystical lights
of the Preaching and the Minor Friars. He was no provincial
recluse, but a person in touch with the intellectual life of his
time. He had connections with the University of Paris,
but the names of his patrons prove him to have been neither
a member nor an enemy of the Mendicant Orders. It is
probable that he was a monk, possible that he was a Carthusian;
a strictly contemplative order celebrated for its mystical
leanings, which produced in the later Middle Ages many
students of the Dionysian writings, and many works upon
contemplation. He was widely read, and many parallels
could be established between his doctrines and the classics
of Christian mysticism. His lost book is so far our only
evidence that abstruse prose treatises of this kind were
already written in the vernacular; and this alone gives it
great interest from the literary point of view. He was, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>far as we know, the first French mystic to write in French;
the forerunner of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Francis de Sales, of Madame Guyon,
of Malaval. If we except the semi-mystical writings of Gerson,
we must wait till the seventeenth century to provide him
with a worthy successor.</p>
<h4 class='c011'><abbr title='two'>II</abbr></h4>
<p class='c003'>We come next to the manner and content of the book. The
manner is that of a dramatic dialogue: an unusual if not
unique form for works of this kind. It consists of a debate—often
a lively debate—between Love, the Soul, Reason,
and a few intervening characters, of whom Pure Courtesy
and Discretion are the chief. The student will at once be
reminded of the <i>Romaunt de la Rose</i>: but he will have
difficulty in matching this form within the confines of ascetic
literature. Duologues, such as those in the Third Book
of the <i>Imitatio</i>, or Suso’s conversations with Eternal Wisdom,
are not uncommon: but I know of no other instance of an
elaborate mystical doctrine presented through the mouths
of a group of symbolic personages.</p>

<p class='c005'>The Soul is naturally that of the author. Lady Love is
his instructress, and all the most beautiful passages are given
to her. Reason’s rôle is interrogatory. He catechises Love
sharply though respectfully, and represents the invariable
attitude of common sense confronted by the claims of mysticism.
Sometimes he goes too far; Love or the Soul is driven
to put him in his place. “Oh, understanding of Reason!”
says this soul noughted, “what thou hast of rudeness! Thou
takest the shell or the chaff and leavest the kernel or the
grain. Thine understanding is so low, that thou mayst not
so highly reach as them behoves that well would have understanding
of the Being that we speak of.” In general, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>the figure of Reason is used with great art to elucidate
the hard sayings of Love. The alert intelligence of the writer
notes all possible objections to his doctrine, and states and
refutes them out of the mouths of his characters. “O Lady
Love, what is this that you say?” says the shocked voice
of Reason whenever the argument becomes paradoxical or
abstruse. “Reason,” says Love to this, “I will answer for
the profit of them for whom thou makest to us this piteous
request. Reason,” says Love, “where be these double words
that thou prayest me to discuss ... it is well asked, and I
will,” says Love, “answer thee to all thy asking.”</p>

<p class='c005'>What, then, is the doctrine which these discussions put
before us? It is the doctrine of the soul’s possible ascent
from illusion to reality, from separateness to union with the
Divine: the primal creed of all mysticism, here stated in
its most extreme form, and pressed to its logical conclusion.
It offers, not a chart of the way to a distant heaven of beatitude
and recompense, but initiation into that state of being
wherein we find our heaven here and now. “I took Jesus
for my heaven,” said Julian of Norwich. So the writer of
the <i>Mirror</i>: “Paradise is no other thing than God Himself ...
why was the thief in Paradise anon as the soul was
departed from his body?... He saw God, that is Paradise;
for other thing is not Paradise than to see God. And this
doth she [the soul] in sooth at all times that she is uncumbered
of herself.” The super-essential and unknowable Godhead,
whose nature is but partially revealed in the Blessed Trinity,
is the only substance of reality, and the only satisfaction of
the soul’s desire. “Though this soul had all the knowledge,
love and learning that ever was given, or shall be given, of
the Divine Trinity, it should be naught as in regard of that
that she loves and shall love ... for there is no other God
but He that none may know, which may not be known.”
The history of human transcendence is the history of the
soul’s transmutation to that condition of love in which it is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>as the author is not afraid to say, deified; and so merged
in the Reality from which it came forth, that it is no longer
aware of its own separate experience but is “all one spirit
with its Spouse.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“I am God,” says Love, “for Love is God and God is
Love. And this soul is God by condition of love, and I am
God by nature divine. And this is hers by right-wiseness of
love. So that this Precious, loved of me, is learned and led
by me out of herself, for she is turned to me, in me.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This process is set forth by the writer of the <i>Mirror</i> under
three chief heads: those of Liberty as the aim, the Will as
the agent, and Surrender as the method of the spiritual quest.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the conception of Liberty as the supreme aim of the
spiritual life we have what is perhaps the most original
feature of his work: though it is a conception which is of
course implicit in the New Testament. Where most contemplatives
lay emphasis on the glad servitude of love, and
use the symbols of wedlock to express the willing subjugation
of the soul to its Divine Bridegroom, the key of this book
is the idea of spiritual freedom; and that freedom as consisting
in the liberation of man’s will from finite desires that
it may rejoin and lose itself within the Will of the Infinite.
We are to learn, it says in the first chapter, something of
“the pure love, of the noble love, and of the high love of the
<i>free</i> soul; and how the Holy Ghost has His sail in his ship.”
With our “inward subtle understanding”—that spiritual
intuition which is the instrument of all real knowledge—we
are to follow its progress from the bondage of desire to the
point at which, purged of self-will, perfected in meekness
and love, “noughted and abased,” it reaches the “Seventh
Estate of Grace,” and participates in the perfect liberty of
Pure Being, wherein “the soul has fulhead of perception by
divine fruition in life of peace.” “Not-willing” is the secret
of liberation, and lord of our true life. “And this not-willing
sows in souls the Divine Seed, fulfilled of the divine will of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>God. This seed may never fail, but few souls dispose them
to receive this seed.” Though this emancipation is only
attained by the utter surrender of all personal desire and
achievement, yet throughout the book the dominant note
is of glad liberation, of flying, of a rapturous ascent. As we
read, we seem to hear from every page “the thunder of new
wings.” The free soul is “six-winged like the seraphim.”
She is “the eagle that flies high: so right high and yet more
high than does any other bird; for she is feathered with fine
love, and she beholds above other the beauty of the sun,
and the beams and the brightness of the sun. Dame Nature,”
says she, “I take leave of you: Love is me nigh, that holds
me free of him against all without dread. Then,” says Love,
“she afraies her nought for tribulation, nor stints for consolation.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It is clear to the writer that only certain persons are capable
of this complete freedom in love: and it is to them—the
natural mystics, the people with a genius for reality—that
his book is addressed. They are “of that lineage that be
folks royal,” “called without fail of the Divine goodness,”
and it is on their spiritual intuition, their transcendent knowledge,
that “all Holy Church is founded”; a suspicious
statement in the eyes of orthodox theology. They possess,
or are able to possess, the incommunicable gift of spiritual
vision.</p>

<p class='c005'>“This gift is given,” says Love, “sometimes in a moment
of time. Who that has it, keep it: for it is the most perfect
gift that God gives to creature.” So removed is the resulting
perception of reality from human wisdom that no
one can teach the illuminated soul anything. “Now for
God,” says Reason, “Lady Love, say what is this to say? This
is to say,” says Love, “that this soul is of so great knowing
that though she had all the knowing of all creatures that
ever were, be or shall be, she would think it naught in regard
of that that she loves.” Yet, true to Neoplatonic principles,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>she is aware that her highest perceptions are nothing, and her
“right great and high words” but “gabbynge” or idle
talk, compared with the ineffable reality. She “wots all
and wots naught,” and is content it should be so. “He only
is my God that none can one word of say, nor all they of
Paradise one only point attain nor understand, for all the
knowing that they have of Him.”</p>

<p class='c005'>But though the Transcendent God is unknowable, the free
soul, in singular contradiction to contemporary asceticism,
finds Him everywhere immanent in the world. “And for
this, that He is all in all, this soul, says Love, finds Him over
all. So that for this all things are to this soul covetable, for
she nor finds anything but she finds God.” So Meister
Eckhart: “To it all creatures are pure to enjoy; for it
enjoyeth all creatures in God and God in all creatures.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The preliminary discipline of the mystic, the hard acquirement
of that “very charity” which is “the perfection of
virtues” and “dwelleth always in God’s sight ... obeying
to nothing that is made but to love” is little dwelt on by
the author of the <i>Mirror</i>; who did not write for beginners
in the contemplative life, but for the mature soul whose
love has made him free, and who therefore needs “nor masses
nor sermons nor fasting nor orisons, and gives to nature all
that he asks, without grudging of conscience”—a practical
application of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Augustine’s dangerous saying, “Love, and
do what you like.” <abbr class='spell'>M.N.</abbr>, however, interpolates a prudent
reminder that “by this way and by sharp contricion souls
must go, or than they come to these divine usages.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The author’s own instructions are really reducible to one
point: the complete and loving surrender of the individual
will to the Primal Will—detachment, or, as he calls it, the
“noughting” of the soul. This is that “peace of charity
in life noughted,” which constitutes the higher life of love;
in contrast to the active life of virtue, struggling to keep
unbroken its attitude of charity to God and man. In it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>the soul dwells, as do the Seraphim, within the divine atmosphere,
and has direct access to the sources of its life. “This
is the proper being of Seraphim: there is nought mediate
between their love and the Divine Love; they have always
its tidings without means. So hath this soul, that seeks
not the divine science amongst the masters of the world,
but the world and herself inwardly despises. Ah, God!
what great difference it is between a gift given by means,
of the Loved to the Lover, and the gift given without means
of the Loved to the Lover. This book says sooth of this
soul. It says she hath six wings as have the Seraphim.
With two she covers the face of our Lord: that is to say,
the more knowledge this soul hath of the Divine Goodness
the more she knows that she knows not the amount of a
mote as in regard to His Goodness, the which is not comprehended
but of Himself. And with two she covers His
feet: this is to say, the more that this soul hath knowledge
of the sufferance that Jesu Christ suffered for us, the more
perfectly she knows that she knows naught, as in regard of
it that He suffered for us, the which is not known but of
Him. And with two she flies, and so dwells in standing and
sitting: this is to say, that all she covets and loves and
prizes, it is the Divine Goodness. These be the wings that
she flies with, and so dwells in standing, for she is alway in
the sight of God: and sitting, for she dwells alway in the
Divine Will. Whereof should this soul have dread, though
she be in the world? An the world, the flesh, and our Enemy
the Fiend, and the four elements, the birds of the air and the
beasts of the field, tormented her and despised her and devoured
her if it might so be, what might she lose if God
dwelled with her? Oh, is he not Almightiful? Yea, without
doubt: He is all might, all wisdom and all goodness, our
Father and Brother and our true Friend.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“This soul,” says Love, “can no more speak of God;
for she is noughted to all outward desires, and of all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>affections of the spirit. So that what this soul does, she
does it by usage of good custom, and by commandment of
Holy Church, without any desire: for will is dead, that
gave her desire.... Who that asks these free souls, sure and
peaceful, if they would be in purgatory, they say nay. If they
would living be certified of their salvation, they say nay. Eh,
what would they? They have nothing of will, this for to
will; and if they willed, they should descend from Love:
for He it is that hath their will.... Thus departs the soul
from her will and the will departs from this soul, so she again
puts it and gives and yields it in God where it was first.”
Such a doctrine easily slides into the complete passivity or
“holy indifference” which was the ideal of the seventeenth
century Quietists: and the <i>Mirror</i> certainly does contain
passages which, if taken alone, would convict their author
of a fondness for this heresy. “I certify thee that these
souls that fine love leads, they have as lief shame as worship,
and worship as shame; and poverty as riches and riches as
poverty; and torments of God and of His creatures as comforts
of God and of His creatures; and to be hated as loved,
and loved as hated; and hell as paradise and paradise as
hell ... the free soul has no will to will or unwill, but only
to will the will of God and suffer in peace His divine ordinance.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Nevertheless, other passages make it clear that active
surrender, not mere passivity is the aim, and that the “noughting”
of the self within the All is a loving sacrifice, consistent
with its achievement of completest happiness. “True love
has but only one intent; and that is, that she might alway
love truly, for of the love of her Lover has she no doubt,
that He does what best is. And she follows this: that she
does that that she ought to do. And she wills nought but
one thing; and that is, that the Will of God be alway in her
done.... This soul,” says Love, “swims in the sea of joy,
that is, in the sea of delights, streaming of divine influences.
She feels no joy, for she herself is joy. She swims and drenches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>in joy, for she lives in joy without feeling any joy. So is joy
in her, that she herself is joy, by the virtue of joy that has
merged her in Him. And so is the will of the Loved and the
will of this soul turned into one as fire and flame.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The teaching of the writer seems to be, that so long as
the will is consciously active and desirous—however good
its actions or desires—its owner cannot be liberated from
the illusions and anxieties of the personal life. What he
needs, if he did but know it, is reunion with that fontal life
from which he came, to which he is perpetually drawn by
love. Here his separate will finds its meaning, and is not
annihilated but absorbed. “The understanding, that gives
light, shows to the soul the thing that she loves. And the
soul that receives by light of understanding the nighing and
the knitting by accord of union in plenteous love, sees the
Being, where that she holds to have her seat; receiving
gladly the light of knowing that brings her tidings of love.
And then she would become so, that she had but one will
and love; and that is, the only will of Him that she loves.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The detached soul who is thus “noughted in God” enjoys
a freedom from stress, an immunity from disappointment
incredible to those who still live the individual life. “Now
shall I say to you what they be that sit in the mountain above
the wind and the rain? These be they that have in earth
neither shame nor worship, nor dread of anything that befalls.”
She has, moreover, passed beyond that moral conflict
which arises from the discord between conscience and desire,
and is the essential character of the active life; for she has
within her “the Master of Virtues, that is called Divine
Love, that has her merged in them all and to Him united.”
Thus she is able to say, “Virtues, I take leave of you for
evermore. Now shall my heart be more free and more in
peace than it has been. Forsooth, I wot well your service
is too travaillous. Sometime I laid my heart in you without
any dissevering: ye wot well this. I was in all thing to you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>obedient. O, I was then your servant: but now I am
delivered out of your thralldom.”</p>

<p class='c005'><abbr class='spell'>M.N.</abbr> is quick to gloss this dangerous declaration: “I am
stirred here to say more to the matter ... when a soul gives
her to perfection, she labours busily day and night to get
virtues by counsel of reason, and strives with vices at every
point, at every word and deed ... thus the virtues be
mistresses and every virtue makes her to war with her contrary....
But so long one may bite on the bitter bark of
the nut that at last he shall come to the sweet kernel. Right
so, ghostly to understand, it fares with these souls that be
come to peacefulness. They have so long striven with vices
and wrought by virtues that they be come to the nut’s kernel,
that is to say, to the love of God, which is sweetness. And
when the soul has deeply tasted this love ... then is she
mistress and lady over the virtues, for she has them all within
herself ... and then this soul takes leave of virtues, as of
thralldom and painful travail ... and now she is lady and
sovereign and they be subjects.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In the technical language of mysticism she has passed
from the active to the contemplative life, the crucial phase
in the evolution of man’s transcendental consciousness.
This evolution is described for us with great psychological
exactness in the <i>Mirror</i>, under the traditional formula of the
“States” of the soul’s ascent. Since few mystics have
escaped the mania for significant numbers, one is not surprised
to find seven steps on this “steep stairway of love.”
“I am called,” says this soul, “of the touchings of Love,
something to say of the Seven Estates that we call beings:
for so it is. And these be the degrees by which man climbs
from the valley, to the top of the mountain that is so several
[apart] that it sees but God.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The First Estate is, That a soul is touched of God by grace
and dissevered from sin: and, as to her power, in intention
to keep the commandments of God.” This is, of course,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>equivalent to the conversion or change of heart which begins
the spiritual life.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The Second is, that a soul hold what God counsels to
His special lovers, passing that what he commands. And
he is no good lover that demenes him not to fulfill all that
the which he wist might best please to his Beloved.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The Third is, that a soul holds the affection of love of
works of perfection, by which her spirit is ripened by desires:
taking the love of these works to multiply in her.
And what does the subtlety of her thought, but makes it
seem to the understanding of her humble affection, that
she cannot make offering to her Love that might comfort
her, but of thing that He loves: for other gift is not prized
in love.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The Fourth is that a soul is drawn by highness of love
into delight of thought by meditation, and relinquishes all
labours outward, and obedience to others, by highness of
love in contemplation. Then the soul is dangerous, noble
and delicious: in which she may not suffer that anything
her touch but the touchings of pure delight of love, in the
which she is singularly gladsome and jolly. What marvel
is it if this soul be upheld and updrawed thus graciously?
Love makes her all drunken, that suffers her not to attend
but to Him.” These four stages have brought the self to
the complete practice of the contemplative life, and prepared
the way for that second great phase in the achievement of
reality which consists in the surrender of the separate will.</p>

<p class='c005'>“The Fifth is, that a soul beholds what God is, and His
Goodness, by Divine Light. She sees the Will, by the spreading
illumination of Divine Light, the which light gives her
the will again to put in God this will; which she may not
without this light yield, that may not her profit unless she
departs from her own will. Thus departs the soul from her
will, and the will departs from this soul, so she again puts
it and gives and yields it in God, where it was first.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>“Now is this soul fallen of love into nought, without the
which nought, she may not all be. The which falling is so
perfectly fallen, if she be fallen aright, that the soul may not
arise out of this deepness, nor she ought not to do it. Within
she ought to dwell. And then leaves the soul pride and play,
for the spirit has become bitter, that suffers her no more to
be playing nor jolly; for the spirit is departed from her that
made her oft love in the highness of contemplation, and in
the fourth estate fierce and dangerous.” Here the spirit of
the mystic experiences that terrible and characteristic reaction
from the exalted joys of contemplation which is sometimes
called the “mystic death” or “dark night of the
soul,” and destroys in it the last roots of selfhood. In this
stage she completes the abandonment or “self-noughting”
which initiate her into that which the German mystics called
“the Upper School of the Holy Spirit.” Thence she passes
to the Sixth Estate, of union with the Divine life, in so far
as it can be achieved by those still in the flesh. The Seventh
is that indescribable state of “glory” or super-essential life,
which constitutes the beatific vision of the Saints, known
only of those that “be fallen of love into this being.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“The Sixth is, that a soul sees neither her nought by
deepness of meekness, nor God by highful bounty. But
God sees it in her of His Divine Majesty that illuminated her
of Him. So that she sees that none is, but God Himself.
And then is a soul in the Sixth Estate of all things made
free, pure and illuminated. Not glorified, for gloryfying is
in the Seventh Estate, that we shall have in glory that none
can speak of. But, pure and clarified, she sees nor God nor
herself: but God sees this of Him, in her, for her, withouten
her, that shows her that there is none but He. Nay, she
knows but Him, nor she loves but Him, nor she praises but
Him, for there is but He. And the Seventh keeps He within
Him, for to give us in everlasting glory. If we wit it not
now, we shall wit it when the body our soul leaves.”</p>

  <h3 id='chap08-b' class='c010'><abbr title='two'>II</abbr> <br> THE BLESSED ANGELA OF FOLIGNO</h3>
</div>
<p class='c003'>It is a curious fact that in the modern revival of interest
in the Franciscan movement, little attention has been paid
to the life and works of Angela of Foligno. Yet, excepting
only <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Bonaventura, this woman has probably exerted a
more enduring, more far-reaching influence than any other
Franciscan of the century which followed the Founder’s
death. In saying this, I do not forget the claims of such great
Franciscans as John of Parma or Jacopone da Todi, nor
yet of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Clare, the Founder of the Second Order. But
the influence of John of Parma was comparatively short-lived;
and that of Jacopone’s superb poetry, though great
in Italy, did not go beyond it. His ecstasies could not be
translated into other tongues. As to <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Clare, with whom
the feminine aspect of the Franciscan ideal first showed itself,
her vocation was to the foundation of a contemplative
order, which should support by its heavenly correspondences
the active and missionary life of the Franciscan friars. The
business of the Second Order is the essential woman’s business,
of keeping the fire of love alight upon the hearth. Its
influence, therefore, was and is almost entirely
confined within the boundaries of the spiritual family. The deepest
wells of Franciscan mysticism are there hidden, and must
always be hidden, from the outer world.</p>

<p class='c005'>But the vocation of Angela of Foligno was, in a sense,
more thoroughly Franciscan than this, more broadly human,
more complete. Like that of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Catherine of Genoa, a mystic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>whom she resembles in certain respects, it was a twofold
vocation: to the eternal and to the temporal, to the divine
and to the human. She was a great contemplative, but she
was also an exceedingly successful teacher of the secrets of
the spiritual life: one of the great line of artist-mediators
between the infinite and the human mind.</p>

<p class='c005'>We know nothing of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Clare’s mystical experience. We
know of Angela’s all that she was able to express; and she
tried hard, though for want of language she confesses that
she often failed. This passionate, faulty, very human woman,
who came to the Mystic Way from a disorderly life, and was
hampered by a natural egotism which she transmuted, it
is true, but never perhaps really killed, has earned the great
title of “Mistress of Theologians.” She penetrated to that
world of realities which the diagrams of theology, like the
temple built with hands, foreshadow upon earth. Her book
of visions and revelations, now so little read, profoundly
affected the religious life of Europe. During the sixteenth
and the seventeenth century we often come upon its traces
in England and in France, as well as in Italy itself; for in
this period it was one of the most widely circulated religious
works. It exerted great influence on <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Francis de Sales,
and also upon the French Quietists. It is quoted as an
authority by Madame Guyon, Poiret, and Malaval; and
through the great English Benedictine, Augustine Baker, and
his pupil, Gertrude More, it has left its mark on the English
Catholic mysticism of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p class='c005'>This book is practically our only trustworthy source for the
facts of Angela’s inner and outer life. It was written in Latin,
at her dictation, by her Franciscan confessor Fra Arnaldo;
at some date subsequent to 1294, since it dates a past event
by the pontificate of Celestine <abbr title='∮the fifth∮'>V</abbr>. It was not printed till the
sixteenth century, when first an Italian translation, and then
the Latin text appeared. Both soon became popular; the
translation being one of the first Italian books of devotion to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>appear in the vulgar tongue. It is divided into three parts,
which must be read in relation with one another. First
we have the history of Angela’s conversion, penitence, and slow,
difficult education in the mystic way: a detailed psychological
document of much interest. Secondly we have, grouped
together, all the visions and revelations which she received
in that way. Unfortunately Fra Arnaldo has seen fit to
arrange these according to their subjects, and not according
to the order in which they were experienced; thereby increasing
their edifying character at the expense of their
scientific worth. Last comes “the evangelical doctrine of
the Blessed Angela”; a treatise largely made up of letters
addressed to her disciples, but, like the writings of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Teresa,
full of illuminating autobiographical touches.</p>

<p class='c005'>Here, then, we have in one volume three aspects of human
life as seen within the limits of one personality: the biographical
facts, the supernal vision, and the ordered conclusions
drawn from those facts and that vision, for the instruction of
other men. All are of value to us in our study of her personality;
for we shall never understand her as a mystic unless
we try first to understand her as a human creature.</p>

<p class='c005'>First as to her outward life. Angela was born of a prosperous
Umbrian family in 1248; twenty-two years after the
death of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Francis, seventeen years before the birth of
Dante. She was one year younger than <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Margaret of Cortona,
the other great Franciscan penitent and contemplative.
Her life, covering the second half of the thirteenth century,
was roughly contemporary with that of Jacopone da Todi,
who was twenty years her senior; and with those “spiritual”
friars, such as Conrad of Offida and John of La Verna,
who are commemorated in the “Little Flowers.” The period,
in Italy, was one of contrasted worldly luxury and spiritual
enthusiasm, and Angela’s life-history appears to have included
experience of both extremes. She married when very young
and had children, but lived a thoroughly worldly if not an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>actually immoral life: posing before society as an excellent
Christian, but actually denying herself few indulgences. We
learn from the list of sins of which she afterwards accused
herself, that these “infirmities and diseases” had included
the washing of her face, the curling, braiding, washing, combing,
and anointing of her hair, wearing of “needless vain and curious
clothes,” and laced shoes adorned with cut leather. She
had also incurred the risk of hell by “vain running and dancing
and walking about for pleasure,” and even by enjoying the
scent of flowers: a crime which <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Francis could hardly have
condemned. Remembering the intensely ascetic tone of
Franciscan penitence and the puritan ideals of the Spiritual
zealots, we need not take these confessions too seriously, or
interpret in the worst sense the “embraces, touches, and other
evil deeds” which she deplores. Nevertheless, the unregenerate
Angela in early womanhood was not the kind of person
whom one would pick out as likely to develop into a saint.
She makes it quite clear to us that she was a vain, self-important,
and hypocritical little egotist, “painted in false colours,
a dissembler within and without.” Probably, like many
women of the world, a nominal Tertiary, she loved to make a
pious impression, but loved comfort even more. “I diligently
made an outward show of being poor, but caused many sheets
and coverings to be put down where I slept, and taken up in
the morning so that none might see them.” There was
an offensive sanctimoniousness about her too. “During
the whole of my life,” she says frankly, “I have studied how
that I might obtain the fame of sanctity.”</p>

<p class='c005'>We do not know the date of Angela’s conversion, or the
circumstances which brought it about; save that it took
place under Franciscan influence, which was of course paramount
in that part of Umbria in her day. It seems to have
taken the form of a gradual awakening of conscience to the
sinfulness and hypocrisy of her life. In her mental distress
she prayed to <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Francis, and he appeared to her in a dream,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>the earliest of her visionary experiences; the confessor to
whom she then went for advice was a Friar Minor, and after
her husband’s death she adopted the plain habit worn by the
more fervent Tertiaries, and remained faithful to the Order
till her death. The fixed dates in her life are few and confusing.
Her own book only gives two: the date of her final purification
and the date of her death. We gather from this and
other sources, however, that after her widowhood she lived
at first with one companion in great retirement; but by about
1290, had formed a small sisterhood in Foligno. Its members,
who observed Franciscan poverty in its full rigour, took the
rule of the Third Order and the three vows of religion, but
they were not cloistered. They devoted themselves to the
care of the sick, and other works of charity.</p>

<p class='c005'>In this community Angela spent the rest of her life; gradually
becoming known as a teacher of “Seraphic wisdom” amongst
those Spiritual Franciscans who were struggling to keep the
ideals of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Francis alive. She seems to have been the centre
of a group of Franciscan Tertiaries of both sexes, for whom she
was at once friend and prophetess, like <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Catherine of Siena
in the next century. Several of her letters to these “sons”
of hers are embedded in her book of “Evangelical Doctrine.”
One of them, the turbulent and ardent friar Ubertino da Casale,
owed to her his true initiation into the spiritual life: and his
account of the impression which she made on him helps us
to understand the nature of her influence. He came to her
from Paris in 1298, when he was twenty-five years old; a
successful preacher, but already conscious of the inward call
to a life of greater perfection. “She restored,” he says, “a
thousandfold all those spiritual gifts I had lost through my
own sins; so that from that time I have not been the same
man that I was before. When I had experienced the splendour
of her radiant virtue, she changed the whole face of my mind,
and so drove out the weakness and languor from my soul and
body and healed my mind that was torn with distraction,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>that no one who knew me before could doubt that the Spirit of
Christ was newly begotten in me through her.” This is almost
our only glimpse of Angela as she was seen by contemporary
eyes: but it indicates the position she came to occupy among
the more devout Franciscan <i>zelanti</i>.</p>

<p class='c005'>She died, surrounded by her spiritual children, in the octave
of the Feast of the Holy Innocents, 1309, aged sixty-one; and
was buried in the Church of the Franciscans at Foligno, where
her body still lies. An Office in her honour was approved by
Gregory <abbr title='∮the fourteenth∮'>XIV</abbr> in 1701, and her Feast is kept throughout
the Franciscan Order on March 30.</p>

<p class='c005'>So much for the scanty outer history. Of greater interest
is our knowledge of her inner life; the real life of mystics and
contemplatives. The history of this inner life assures us that
Angela was of the stuff of which great mystics are made;
though not at all of the stuff of which many amateurs of
mysticism expect them to be made. First great necessity,
she possessed a strongly romantic temperament; like <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Francis, Suso, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius, Mechthild, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Teresa, her companions
on the highway of the soul. Like these, she had
also an innate simplicity and ardour, a character at once
childlike and heroic; that “all-or-none” reaction, the power
of total self-giving to the matter in hand, which distinguishes
the hero, whether as man of action, as artist, or as saint. Indeed,
heroism may properly be ascribed to a comfortable and
self-indulgent married woman, who leaves all for the lonely
adventure of Sinai, however many tumbles she may have upon
the road. With this courage she combined an extreme sensibility
to impressions, great power of endurance, a strong will;
all the potentialities of a great sinner or a great saint. Further,
she evidently possessed that peculiar, unstable psychic makeup,
which the mystic shares with other types of genius; and
which is seen in its full development in the two greatest
of Italian saints, Francis of Assisi and Catherine of Siena.
She experienced all the normal episodes of complete mystical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>development: the phases of penitence and self-discipline,
illumination and dereliction, and at last that ecstatic union
with the Divine Nature which is the goal of the Way. Her
mysticism was deeply coloured by the Franciscan atmosphere
in which it was nurtured; it exhibited the highly emotional
and enthusiastic character, the tendency to eccentric penances,
the concentration upon the Cross and Passion of Christ, which
are found in her contemporary Jacopone da Todi, and are
typical of the Franciscan mystics at their best. Indeed,
the many parallels between Angela and Jacopone suggest to
us that the favourite subjects of their contemplations were
those in vogue in “Spiritual” circles at this time; and that
we have in their works the surviving examples of a complete
school of mysticism, which taught, as Ubertino da Casale
says that Cecilia of Florence did, “the whole art of the higher
contemplation.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“As I walked,” said the Blessed Angela, “by the way of
penitence, I took eighteen spiritual steps before I came to
<i>know</i> the imperfections of my life.” This is the first sentence
of the book of <i>Conversion and Penitence</i> which analyses
in detail the changes through which she passed on her
way to complete self-knowledge and self-adjustment. Those
“eighteen steps” extended over many years. When they
began, Angela was living luxuriously, as a married woman, in
her husband’s house. When they ended, she was a poor widow
vowed to the religious life; stripped of every superfluity,
everything that would entangle her in the web of appearance,
apt in contemplation, companioned by visions, esteemed
as a teacher and an ecstatic, and the centre of a group of
disciples. Her inner life, during these years of ascent, of
hard and difficult growth, seems to have been a life of bitter
and almost continuous struggle. Even after the preliminary
steps of repentance were over, and her visionary powers had
developed, the new spiritual ideals demanded of her ever
more difficult renunciations. We see her, as we read the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>wonderful memoirs of her years of penitence, perpetually
flung to and fro between adoration and contrition; as first
one element and then the other of her complex personality
took the upper hand. In her long and slow ascent towards
the stars, she alternately experienced the sunshine and the
shade.</p>

<p class='c005'>From the turmoil which surrounded the hard re-making of
Angela’s character, there emerged two great principles round
which her subsequent life and teaching were to be grouped.
The first was poverty, the second was self-knowledge. Naturally
her instinct for poverty would be fostered by her Franciscan
environment; but it is an instinct implicit in the mystical
temperament, and not peculiar to the Poor Man of Assisi.
Mystics know that possessions dissipate the energy which
they need for other and more real things; that they must
give up ownership, the verb “to have,” if they are to attain
the freedom which they seek, and all the fullness of the verb
“to be.” Thus Jacopone in his great ode expressed a universal
spiritual law:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“Povertate è nulla avere</div>
      <div class='line'>e nulla cosa poi volere;</div>
      <div class='line'>ed omne cosa possedere</div>
      <div class='line'>en spirito de libertate.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It cost Angela many struggles before she fully accepted and
acted upon this truth, and attained that which she calls the
“liberty of poverty.” Self-knowledge, that hard essential of
the soul’s re-education which Richard of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Victor, and
afterwards <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Catherine of Siena, made the starting-point of
all mysticism, she recognized from the first as the true objective
towards which her hard penances and long meditations must
tend.</p>

<p class='c005'>The eighteen “steps,” then, exhibit with extraordinary
honesty her gradual progress in these two arts of self-knowledge
and renunciation. At the first step, as we have seen,
she was by something—we know not what—startled into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>attention to the real, and terrified by the vision of her own
naked reality stripped of its pleasant veils and self-deceits.
Her first reaction to this vision was avoidance. She was
ashamed to look her sins in the face, or confess them. But
having prayed to <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Francis, she was led by a dream—the
form under which her unconscious mind most frequently
controlled her—to seek a Franciscan friar and make a general
confession of her sins. She performed his penance loyally,
and became increasingly contrite for her faults: the sense of
Divine Mercy touching her, and evoking an ever more humble
and repentant grief. By the eighth step this contrition had
become love, the passion for perfection triumphing over the
hatred of imperfection. By that contemplation of the Cross
which was specially dear to Franciscan devotion, and is the
subject of one of Jacopone’s most splendid poems, she was led
into an ever deeper understanding of the mystery of redemption
by pain. Angela was now definitely committed to the
mystic way. “In this beholding of the Cross,” she says, “I
burned with the fire of love and remorse: so that standing
before that Cross I divested myself of everything and offered
myself to Him ... and the aforesaid fire compelled me, and
I had no power to resist.” The special form which her renunciation
took—that of a vow of chastity in deed and thought—suggests
the direction in which her chief temptations lay;
and this deduction is made more probable by the emotional
quality of her visionary experience, in which the repressed
ardours of her temperament found relief.</p>

<p class='c005'>At the ninth step, this instinct for renunciation achieved
more complete expression. “Enlightened and instructed”—doubtless
by some member of the spiritual group—she learned
that nothing less than a total sacrifice of friends, kindred,
possessions, her very self, would serve her if she wished to
tread the Way of Holy Cross. But in her acceptance of
this bitter truth we still see something of the vanity, self-importance
and narrow egotism of the old Angela. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>is the one passage in all her writings which every one knows,
and by which she is generally, and most unfairly, judged.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I elected to walk on the thorny path which is the path of
tribulation. So I began to put aside the fine clothing and
adornments which I had, and the most delicate food, and also
the covering of my head. But as yet, to do all these things
was hard, and shamed me, because I did not feel much love
for God, and was living with my husband. So that it was
a bitter thing to me when anything offensive was said or done
to me; but I bore it as patiently as I could. In that time,
and by God’s will, there died my mother, who was a great
hindrance to me in following the way of God; my husband
died likewise; and in a short time there also died all my
children. And because I had begun to follow the aforesaid
way, and had prayed God to rid me of them, I had great
consolation of their deaths, although I also felt some grief;
wherefore, because God had shown me this grace, I imagined
that my heart was in the heart of God and His will and His
heart in my heart.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This unfortunate paragraph outweighs for many minds
the whole of Angela’s subsequent life and achievements. I
do not deny that, taken alone, it appears to be a monument of
spiritual egotism. But we must remember that it represents,
not Angela the peaceful mystic, but Angela the worried and
storm-tossed penitent at the most difficult moment of her
career. The emotional centre of her life had shifted. An
inexorable inner voice now urged her to a total concentration
on God, and she knew that the way of penance and renunciation
was her only hope. Yet living in a thoroughly discordant,
thoroughly unspiritual environment, hemmed in on all sides
by conventional existence and unsympathetic surroundings,
this way seemed impossible to follow in its completeness; for she
was not one of those who are able to harmonize the demands
of both worlds. Moreover, these words were written by one
who had long outlived the human sorrow which, as she says
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>here and in another place, she felt at these accumulated bereavements.
Now, looking back and seeing her past existence
spread out before her, she recognized even this awful and
drastic series of deprivations as a necessary factor in the life to
which she was called.</p>

<p class='c005'>After all, it is fair to acknowledge that family affection
is not the strongest point in the character of the mystical
saints. In the interests of their vocation, they are always
ready to leave father, mother, brothers, and sisters; and moreover
there is evangelical authority for this attitude. They
are specialists, and are therefore bound, in the interests of
the race, to give up many things which other men must
develop and preserve. Artists are under much the same
necessity. The vitality which we diffuse amongst many
interests and loves, these must concentrate on the one object
of their quest. Hence <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Francis himself flung his family
aside without scruple when it came to the parting of the ways.
Hence Jacopone da Todi was warned that even spiritual
friendships must be held lightly by the pilgrim on the way of
the Cross. Angela was only following in their footsteps,
though she doubtless expressed herself with unnecessary and
ill-regulated vigour, when she recognized human ties and
human affections as possible impediments of the spiritual
life. An easy capitulation to love and friendship in their
most engrossing aspects seems always to have been her standing
danger. It caused her in later life to say that she “feared
love more than all other things”; even regarding with
suspicion the deep affection which unites teacher and disciples,
or two fellow-initiates of the contemplative life.</p>

<p class='c005'>It was after her release from the duties of family life, and
her more complete concentration on the ascetic life, that
her visionary powers began to develop. At first they were
little more than waking dreams of a commonplace kind;
imaginary pictures of the Passion, the Crucifix, the Sacred
Heart, such as have been experienced by innumerable Catholic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>saints. These vivid symbolic presentations of Divine love
moved Angela to greater and more heroic heights of penitential
love; and the passion for complete evangelical poverty came
on her with renewed force. Her possessions enchained her,
and she knew it. She made many efforts to screw herself up
bit by bit to those heights of renunciation which <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Francis
seems to have reached almost without effort.</p>

<p class='c005'>“For this cause—namely, to have the liberty of poverty—I
journeyed to Rome, to pray the Blessed Peter that he would
obtain for me the grace of true poverty. It seemed to me at
last that I could not sufficiently do penance whilst I was possessed
of worldly things ... so I determined to forsake
everything. In my imagination I had a great desire to become
poor, and such was my zeal, that I often feared to die before I
attained this state of poverty. On the other hand, I was
assailed by temptations, which whispered to me that I was
still young, that begging for alms might lead me into shame and
danger; that if I did this, I should die of hunger, cold, and
nakedness. Moreover, all my friends dissuaded me from it.
But at last Divine mercy sent a great illumination into my
heart, which, as I believed then and do now, I shall never lose
even in eternity.... So then I did resolve in good earnest.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Here is the final, deliberate act of will: the turning once
for all from the unreal to the real—under whatever form the
charms of unreality appear to the growing self—which all
mystics have to make. It was Angela’s eleventh step. Her
mystical powers were now developing rapidly. They showed
themselves in visions, dreams, and ecstasies. Not all of these,
it is true, can be accepted as marks of spiritual growth: for
some clearly represent the re-emergence under religious symbols
of old emotions and desires. But the deep and vivid intuitions
of spiritual realities which came to her more and more frequently,
show that a steady sublimation of those emotions
and desires was in progress, and that they tended more and
more towards supersensual ends.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>At the fifteenth step, with truly Franciscan thoroughness—though,
oddly enough, the Friars Minor whom she consulted
forbade her to do it—she distributed the whole of her
possessions amongst the poor. “Because methought I
could not keep anything for myself without greatly offending
Him who did thus enlighten me.” With this crucial act she
seems to have attained at last the true and full state of illumination.
“Then,” she says, “I began to feel the sweetness of
God in my heart”: that which other mystics have called
the “sense of the Presence.” Also, “I began to have understanding
of the visions and the words”; a new spiritual
lucidity running side by side with the symbolic pictures and
imaginary voices that she saw and heard with the inner eye
and ear. This, too, is normal and characteristic. From this
point, then, we must read the book of <i>Visions and Consolations</i>
side by side with the book of <i>Penances</i> if we would
understand Angela’s inner life; for these two forms of experience,
which she has unfortunately chosen to treat separately,
alternated with one another.</p>

<p class='c005'>In the time of her total acceptance of holy poverty, Angela
seems to have been living in a state of almost hermit-like
simplicity with one companion, the Blessed Paschalina of
Foligno; whom at first she found a “weariness,” but afterwards
discovered to be a fellow traveller on the Mystic Way.
Some years had now passed since her conversion; and she
was already accepted—perhaps indeed celebrated—as a
religious teacher among the members of the Spiritual group.
Definitely vowed to the service of the Franciscan Order, she
seems soon to have become like <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Catherine of Siena, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Catherine of Genoa, and many other women mystics, the centre
of a group of adoring disciples or “spiritual sons.” Yet her
inner life was still in a state of confusion, the remaking of her
character was still in progress. She was flung perpetually
to the extremes of joy and anguish. She would rise to great
heights of mystical passion “filled with the fire and fervour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>of Divine love,” only to fall back to her old temptations. The
repressed instinctive life began to take its revenge, and
tortured her by vicious suggestions which she had never
known before. “I would have chosen rather to be roasted
than to endure such pains.” Also the great strain put upon
her nervous system by the growing spiritual faculties resulted
in absolute physical illness, as has been the case with many
of the mystical saints. “The torments of my body,” she
says, “were veritably numberless. There remained not one
of my members that was not grievously tormented, nor was I
ever free from pain, infirmity, or weariness.”</p>

<p class='c005'>We need not be afraid to recognize in this struggle a reflection
of the stresses and difficulties—some physical—which attend
on the complete sublimation of man’s psychic life; especially
in persons of a strongly emotional temperament. In Angela’s
case the visions and dreams that accompanied it assure us
of the character of the crisis through which she was passing.
Many of her symptoms at this time were undoubtedly hysterical.
She cried aloud when she heard the name of God, and
fell into a fever on seeing a picture of the Passion of Christ.
Her tears were perpetual, and often she longed to tear herself
in pieces. Unfortunately Franciscan piety of the more
extreme sort encouraged emotional extravagances of this
kind, as we may see by the account of Angela’s contemporaries
given in the “Little Flowers,” and failed to appreciate
Jacopone’s profound distinction between ordered and disordered
love. It also gave unqualified approval to those
public and grotesque acts of self-abasement which play so
large a part in the legend of his penitence; and here again,
Angela was true to type. Still grieved by the memory of her
old hypocrisies, made more poignant by the reverence she
received from her disciples, she went through the city and
open places with meat and fishes hanging from her neck, and
crying, “I am that woman full of evil and dissembling, slave
of all vices and iniquities, who did good deeds that she might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>obtain honour among men; and especially when I caused
those bidden to my house to be told that I ate neither fish nor
meat, and—being the while greedy, gluttonous, and drunken—feigned
to desire nought but what was needful.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Those familiar with the lives of the mystics will remember
many parallels to this state of conflict: the ups and downs
of Suso, his alternate illumination and despair, his great
self-denials balanced by foolish little sins: the thirty years
during which Teresa—already, like Angela, regarded as a
great example—swayed between her mystical vocation and
the claims of a more normal life. In Angela this inward
battle culminated, she says, “some little while before the
time of the pontificate of Celestino”—that is to say about
1294, when she was forty-six—and endured for more than two
years. In it, in addition to bodily and mental agony, she
was humiliated by recurrent temptations to sensual indulgence.
Her depression was extreme, and her intellect often
so clouded that she could not even recall the idea of God to
her mind. It was her last lesson in humility and self-knowledge—an
excellent antidote to the dangers of professional
sanctity—and answered to that terrible period of final purification
which other mystics have called the “Dark Night of the
Soul.”</p>

<p class='c005'>From this last purgation, in which all the elements of
her character seemed flung back into the melting-pot, she
emerged into that condition of spiritual equilibrium, of perfect
harmony with transcendent reality, which is known to mystic
writers as the Unitive Way. “A divine change,” she says,
“took place in my soul, which neither saint nor angel could
describe or explain. Wherefore I say again that it seems
to me evil speaking or blasphemy if I try and tell of it.”
Again, “I came not to this state of my own self, but was
led and drawn thereto by God; so that though of my own
self I should not have known how to desire or ask for it, I
am now in that state continually.” Though the capacity for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>pain never left her, and is implied in many of her greatest
revelations—for, like all the great Catholic mystics, she
found the Christian paradox of joyous suffering at the very
centre of truth—yet the last twelve years of her life seem to
have been years of profound inward peace. “He hath placed
within my soul,” she said, “a state which changes little, and
I possess God in such fullness that I am no longer in the
state in which I used to be; but I walk in such perfect peace
of heart and mind that I am content in all things.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It was that state of which Jacopone has written:</p>

<p class='c008'>Angela has two claims to the title of a great mystic: that
of her life, which we have briefly considered, and that of the
revelations and experiences which she reports; our chief evidence
of the unique nature of her consciousness. What
then was the nature of these visions and revelations? There
are signs in her book that she ran through the whole gamut
of mystical experience. She practised, and described, all
those degrees of contemplative prayer which are analyzed
by <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Teresa and <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John of the Cross. She heard interior
voices. She saw visions. She was an ecstatic. Moreover,
at least after her achievement of spiritual equilibrium—for
it would be unfair to take into account the morbid states from
which she suffered during the period of readjustment—her
ecstasies were of that rare and supernal kind which, far
from being signs of mental or nervous disease, actually renew
and invigorate the physical life of those who experience them.
There is a beautiful passage in the life of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Catherine of Genoa
in which she is described as coming joyous and rosy-faced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>from the ecstatic encounter with God’s love. So Angela
says: “Because of the change in my body, therefore I was
not able to conceal my state from my companion, or from other
people with whom I consorted; because at times my face
was all resplendent and rosy, and my eyes shone like
candles. When the soul is assured of God and refreshed by
His presence, the body also receives health, satisfaction, and
nobility.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Her revelations were of two kinds. First we have a long
series of “imaginary visions”: pictures, no doubt representing
deep and imageless intuitions, resulting as it were from
some communion with reality, but taking their form—as distinct
from their content—from the memory and imagination
of the visionary. Though many of these must be classed as
dreams, and some indeed were received in sleep, others were
definite experiences; seen, as she says, with the eyes of the
mind, far more clearly than anything can be seen with the
eyes of the body. Nevertheless we are bound to consider
them less as objective revelations than as vivid artistic
reconstructions; symbols of something that she has felt and
known. Angela’s religious beliefs and romantic leanings are
both clearly reflected in them. Some deal with the physical
accidents of the Passion—always a favourite subject of the
mediæval visionary—and these closely resemble the series
of Passion-pictures seen by Julian of Norwich. Others are
inspired by her devotion to the Eucharist. One or two
seem, like the Visions of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Gertrude, to anticipate the later
cult of the Sacred Heart. In virtue of these visions Angela
belongs to the great family of women Catholic mystics; women
possessing a rich emotional life, and, largely by means of that
emotional life, actualizing and expressing their communion
with the spiritual world.</p>

<p class='c005'>We see this emotional character clearly in one of Angela’s
most celebrated experiences; the one of all others which seems
to have set the seal on her career as a religious teacher, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>which is placed at the beginning of her book of visions and
revelations, though there was no vision involved in it. I mean
the beautiful scene in which she talked with the Holy Ghost,
walking on “the narrow road which leads upward to Assisi,
and is beyond Spello.” That sense of heavenly intimacy, of
divine communion, of a destiny pressed upon her from the
spiritual sphere, which then took possession of her consciousness,
was translated by the surface-mind of the natural Angela—whose
nearest parallels to such an experience were found
amongst the emotional incidents of human love—into the
wonderful imaginary conversation in which, as she climbs the
path between the vineyards, she is wooed by the Holy Spirit,
and assured of His peculiar interest and affection. “I will
bear thee company and speak with thee all the way,” He says
to her. “I will make no end to My speaking, and thou wilt
not be able to attend to anything save Me.” “Then did He
begin to speak the following words to me, which persuaded
me to love after this manner, ‘My daughter, who art sweet
to Me, My daughter who art My temple, My beloved daughter,
do thou love Me, for I love thee greatly, and much more than
thou lovest Me.’ And very often He said to me, ‘Bride and
daughter! sweet art thou to Me; I love thee better than any
other in the valley of Spoleto.’ These and other similar
things did He say to me. Then when I heard these words, I
counted my sins, and I considered my faults; how that I was
unworthy of so great a love. And I began to doubt these
words; for which cause, my soul said to Him who had spoken
to it, ‘If thou wert indeed the Holy Spirit, thou wouldest not
speak thus; for it is not right or proper, because I am weak and
frail and might grow vainglorious thereat.’ He answered,
‘Think and see if thou couldst become vainglorious because
of the things for which thou art now made glad....’ Then I
tried to grow vainglorious, that I might prove if He spoke
truth; and I began to look at the vineyards, that I might
learn the folly of my words. And wherever I looked, He said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>to me, ‘Behold and see! this is My creation’: and at this
I felt ineffable delight.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This is the poetry of mysticism, an artistic reduction of
supernal intuitions, and is to be interpreted in poetic terms.
But there is another, and rarer, form of spiritual perception:
that imageless intuition of pure truth, which <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Teresa
and other mystics call intellectual, but which would be
better named metaphysical vision. Angela’s real importance
amongst the mystics comes from the fact that she possessed
this power in a high degree of development. In virtue of her
immediate apprehensions of transcendent reality, she belongs
to the rarest and highest type of mystic seer: a class
in which Plotinus holds perhaps the first place, and of which
Ruysbroeck is the most conspicuous mediæval example.
The poetry of Jacopone da Todi shows us that he too knew
the secret of those strange astounding regions, “beyond the
polar circle of the mind,” where Angela tasted of unconditioned
reality, and the language in which he describes them
often reminds us of her. It is an interesting question, whether
these two great Franciscan contemplatives directly influenced
one another, or must be regarded as the twin stars of a school
of “Seraphic wisdom” which taught the deepest mysteries
of the spiritual life.</p>

<p class='c005'>There are eight of these great visionary experiences recorded
in Angela’s book. In them she says that she apprehended
God successively under the attributes of Goodness,
Beauty, Power, Wisdom, Love, Justice; and that after this
she beheld the totality of the Godhead “darkly”—a way of
describing her perceptions which is of course traceable to the
“Divine darkness” of Dionysius the Areopagite. Finally she
beheld it, “as clearly as is possible in this life.” All these
visions seem to have come to her when she was in a state of
ecstasy or trance. She speaks of being “exalted in spirit,”
“rapt to the first elevation”; lifted to wholly new levels of
consciousness. She describes them as well as she can, yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>plainly she is only able to tell us a fraction of her experience.
Over and over again she declares the hopeless inadequacy
of human speech, the impossibility of “speaking as she
saw.” Her state is like that of Dante at the end of the
<i>Paradiso</i>, save that her wings were fitted for these flights.</p>

<p class='c005'>“I beheld the ineffable fullness of God; but I can relate
nothing of it, save that I have <i>seen</i> the fullness of Divine
Wisdom, wherein is all goodness.” Again, “inasmuch as this
was a supernatural thing, I cannot express it in words.”
“Many other things were clearly set forth to me; but I neither
can nor will relate them.” “All that I say of this, seems to
me to be nothing. I feel as though I offended in speaking of it,
for so greatly does the Good exceed all my words that my
speech seems to be but blasphemy.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Those things, however, which she does contrive to relate,
have an astonishing suggestive quality, a great philosophic
sweep, combined with an intimate appeal to our own deepest
intuitions, which place them, so far as mystical history is
concerned, on a level with some of the greatest passages in
Jacopone da Todi and in Ruysbroeck; and in my opinion
far beyond the more celebrated intellectual visions of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Teresa.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus she says, “the eyes of my soul were opened and I
beheld the plenitude of God, by which I understood the whole
world both here and beyond the sea, the abyss, and all other
things. And in this I beheld nothing save the Divine Power,
in a way that is utterly indescribable, so that through the
greatness of its wonder the soul cried with a loud voice, saying,
‘The whole world is full of God.’ Wherefore I understood
that the world is but a little thing; and I saw that the
power of God was above all things, and the whole world was
filled with it.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Here we are reminded of Julian of Norwich—“He showed
me a little thing, the quantity of an hazel nut. I looked
thereon with the eye of my understanding and thought; What
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>may this be? and it was answered generally thus: It is all
that is made.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“After I had seen the power of God, His will and His
justice,” says Angela, again, “I was lifted higher still; and
then I no longer beheld the power and will as before. But I
beheld a <i>Thing</i>, as fixed and stable as it was indescribable;
and more than this I cannot say, save that I have often said
already, namely, that it was all good. And although my soul
beheld not love, yet when it saw that indescribable <i>Thing</i>, it
was itself filled with indescribable joy, so that it was taken
out of the state it was in before, and placed in this great and
ineffable state. I know not whether I was then in the body or
out of the body. It is enough to say that all the other visions
seemed to me less great than this.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Again, “One time in Lent ... the eyes of my soul were
opened, and I saw Love advancing gently towards me, and I
saw the beginning but not the end. There seemed to me
only a continuation and an eternity thereof, so that I cannot
tell its likeness nor colour; but directly this Love reached
me I beheld all these things more clearly with the eyes of
the soul than I could do with the eyes of the body. This
Love came towards me after the manner of a sickle. Not
that there was any actual and measurable likeness; but
when first it appeared to me it did not give itself to me in
such abundance as I expected, but a part was withdrawn.
Therefore I say, after the manner of a sickle. Then I was
filled with love and a great satisfaction, but although it satisfied
me, it generated within me so great a hunger that all my
members were loosened; and my soul fainted with longing
to attain to the All.”</p>

<p class='c005'>I give one more, particularly interesting to English students
because of its parallels with our own great mystical work, <i>The
Cloud of Unknowing</i>: “There was a time when my soul was
exalted to behold God with so much clearness that never before
had I beheld Him so distinctly. But I did not here see Love so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>fully; rather I lost that which I had before, and was left
without love. Afterwards I saw Him darkly, and this darkness
was the greatest blessing that could be imagined, and thought
can conceive nothing equal to this.... Here likewise I see
all Good.... The soul delights unspeakably therein, yet
it beholds nothing that can be spoken by the tongue or conceived
by the heart. It sees nothing yet sees all, because it
beholds the Good darkly; and the more darkly and secretly
the Good is seen, the more certain it is, and excellent above
all things. Wherefore all other good that can be seen or
imagined is doubtless less than this, and even when the soul
sees the Divine wisdom, power and will of God (which I have
seen marvellously at other times), it is all less than this most
certain Good. Because this is the whole, and those other
things are but part of the whole.... But seen thus darkly,
the Good brings no smile to the lips, no fervour of love to
the heart; for the body does not tremble or become moved
and distressed as at other times; because the soul sees, and
not the body, which rests and sleeps, and the tongue is dumb
and speechless. All the many ineffable kindnesses which God
has shown me, all the sweet words and divine sayings and
doings, are so much less than this that I saw in the darkness,
that I put no hope in them.... But to this most high
power of beholding God ineffably through great darkness,
my spirit was uplifted three times only and no more.”</p>

<p class='c005'>“This cloud,” says <i>The Cloud of Unknowing</i>, of that same
Divine Dark, “is evermore between thee and thy God ...
therefore shape thyself to abide in this darkness so long as
thou mayest, evermore crying after Him whom thou lovest,
for if ever thou shalt feel Him or see Him (in such sort as He
may be seen or felt in this life) it behoveth always to be in this
cloud or darkness.” So Angela: “When I behold and am
in that Good, although I seem to see nothing yet I see all
things.” In this achievement she reaches the goal of the mystic
experience, the ecstatic communion with the Absolute One.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>I have called her a Franciscan mystic. If by Franciscan
mysticism we mean that exquisite sense of the Divine immanence
in nature, that poetic temperament, that peculiar and
elusive charm, which we associate with <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Francis himself;
then, perhaps, there seems little that is characteristically
Franciscan in Angela. But if, looking past the special character
of the Founder, we try to seize the essence of that secret
he was seeking to impart, then, allowing for the inevitable
development which any idea undergoes when it enters the
world of change, we may regard her as a typical Franciscan
of the second generation. She was indeed conditioned at
all points by the Franciscan environment in which her religious
life developed; that ardent society of “Spirituals,” mostly
recruited from the devout laity, which sprang up in her time
in the Italian cities. This society, with its advanced contemplative
tradition, its demand for a close imitation of Christ,
was a forcing-house of the mystical life. Angela shows her
close connection with it in the character of her penitence,
in her passionate devotion to the Cross and Passion, and also
in the metaphysical quality of her greatest mystical apprehensions.
These three outstanding characteristics, corresponding
in a general sense to the three great phases of the
mystical life, are again seen in the poetry in which her contemporary
Jacopone discloses to us the stages of anguished
contrition and of uncontrolled fervour through which he moved
to the heights of union with God. These two great converts
and initiates of love illuminate and explain one another: for
in them we see an identical tradition of the spiritual life
interpreted by different temperaments. For each the Way is
an education in love, and Jacopone speaks for both of them
when he says of it:</p>

  <h3 id='chap08-c' class='c010'><abbr title='three'>III</abbr> <br> JULIAN OF NORWICH.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c003'>All that we know directly of Julian of Norwich—the most
attractive, if not the greatest of the English mystics—comes
to us from her book, <i>The Revelations of Divine Love</i>, in which
she has set down her spiritual experiences and meditations.
Like her contemporaries, Walter Hilton and the author of
<i>The Cloud of Unknowing</i>, she lives only in her vision and her
thought. Her external circumstances are almost unknown to
us, but some of these can be recovered, or at least deduced,
from the study of contemporary history and art; a source of
information too often neglected by those who specialize in
religious literature, yet without which that literature can
never wholly be understood.</p>

<p class='c005'>Julian, who was born about 1342, in the reign of Edward
<abbr title='∮the third∮'>III</abbr>, grew up among the surroundings and influences natural
to a deeply religious East Anglian gentlewoman at the close
of the Middle Ages. Though she speaks of herself as “unlettered,”
which perhaps means unable to write, she certainly
received considerable education, including some Latin, before
her <i>Revelations</i> were composed. Her known connection with
the Benedictine convent of Carrow, near Norwich, in whose
gift was the anchorage to which she retired, suggests that she
may have been educated by the nuns; and perhaps made her
first religious profession at this house, which was in her time
the principal “young ladies’ school” of the Norwich diocese,
and a favourite retreat of those adopting the religious life.
During her most impressionable years she must have seen in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>their freshness some of the greatest creations of Gothic art,
for in Norfolk both architecture and painting had been carried
to the highest pitch of excellence by the beginning of the
fourteenth century. The great East Anglian school of
miniature painting had already produced its masterpieces and
was in its decadence. But if we look at these masterpieces—the
wonderful manuscripts illuminated at Gorleston near Yarmouth,
and other religious houses of the district—and remember
that these are merely the surviving examples of an art
which decorated the walls of the churches as richly as the
pages of its service-books, we begin to realize the sort of
iconography, the view of the Christian landscape, from which
Julian’s mental furniture was derived. Some of the best of
these manuscripts are in the British Museum; and those who
wish to understand the atmosphere in which the mediæval
mystics flourished would do well to study Julian’s <i>Revelations</i>
in their light. There they will find expressed in design
that mixture of gaiety and awe, that balanced understanding
of the natural and the divine, which is one of her strong
characteristics. She, like these artists, can afford to wreathe
her images of supernatural mysteries in homely details drawn
from the common life. Moreover, the more pictorial her
revelations become, the more closely they approximate to
the pictures in the psalters and Books of Hours of her time.
From this source came her detailed visions of incidents in the
Passion—the blood that she saw running down under the garland
of thorns, the dried, discoloured body, the gaping wounds,
and “rueful and wasted” face of Christ—and those of the
Blessed Virgin as a “little maiden,” as “Mater Dolorosa,” and
as the crowned Queen of Heaven. All these were common
subjects with the miniature artists and wall painters of the
time, and the form which they took in Julian’s revelations
must be attributed to a large extent to unconscious memory
of those artists’ works.</p>

<p class='c005'>Another more inward aspect of contemporary religion has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>also affected her: the cult of the Holy Name of Jesus. This
beautiful devotion was specially characteristic of English
personal religion in the late Middle Ages, and is strongly
marked in the writings of the mystics; especially Hilton and
Rolle. The great popularity in England of the hymn <i>Jesu
Dulcis Memoria</i>, and the many vernacular imitations of it
current in Julian’s day, helped in the spread of this cult; with
which was associated that intense and highly emotional preoccupation
with the physical accidents of the Passion so
constantly reflected in her visionary experience. “O good
Jesu!” cried Rolle, “my heart thou hast bound in love of
Thy Name and now I cannot but sing it”; and he spoke not
for himself only but for all the best religious lyrists of the
early fourteenth century, whose characteristic mood was that
of personal, intimate, and sorrowing love of Jesus.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sweet Jesu, now will I sing</div>
      <div class='line'>To thee, a song of love longing.</div>
      <div class='line'>Teach me, Lord, thy love song</div>
      <div class='line'>With sweet tears ever among.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Thus, one of these Middle English poets could write:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Jesu, well owe I to love thee</div>
      <div class='line'>For that me showed the roodë tree,</div>
      <div class='line'>The crown of thorns, the nailës three,</div>
      <div class='line'>The sharp spear that through-stong thee,</div>
      <div class='line'>Jesu of love is sooth tokening</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy head down-bowed to love-kissing,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thine arms spread to love-clipping,</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy side all open to love-showing.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Of such poetry as this—with which she was probably familiar—Julian
often reminds us; and sometimes her parallels with
it are close. Thus she says in her tenth Revelation: “Then
with a glad cheer our Lord looked into his side, and beheld
rejoicing. With his sweet looking he led forth the understanding
of his creature by the same wound into his side
within. And then he showed a fair delectable place and large
enough for all mankind that shall be saved to rest in peace
and in love.... And with this our good Lord said full
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>blissfully: Lo! how that I loved thee.” In such passages
as this, in her highly visualized meditations on the Crown of
Thorns and the Precious Blood, and in such phrases as “I
liked none other heaven than Jesus, who shall be my bliss
when I am there,” and other ardent expressions of religious
love, she is speaking the common devotional language and
using the common devotional imagery of her own day. Hence
those merely visionary experiences with which her book opens
and which form by far the least important part of it, can be
accounted for as the result of unconscious memory, weaving
new vivid pictures from the current religious and artistic
conceptions in which she had been reared. A correspondence
has indeed been detected between the order of these fifteen
“showings,” and the fifteen prayers on the Passion known as
the “<abbr title='fifteen'>XV</abbr> Os,” which occur in the <i>Sarum Horæ</i>. They are,
in fact, dreams of which any devout and imaginative person
of that time was capable; and need not be taken too seriously
when estimating the character of Julian’s mysticism.</p>

<p class='c005'>This, then, was the religious, artistic, and emotional environment
in which she grew up; an environment to which new
sombre colour and new realization of pain had been given by
the Black Death which swept through Norfolk when she was a
child. More important, however, than any external influence,
was the part her own temperament played in her special
apprehension of God. It is plain that she was from the first
of an intensely religious, meditative disposition. As a girl,
she says, she asked of God three things. The first was, that
she might have a keen realization of Christ’s Passion; because
although she had great feeling of it, she desired more, and
specially a bodily sight of His pains. The second was bodily
sickness, much esteemed in the Middle Ages as a means of
grace; and this she wished to suffer at thirty years of age.
The third was, that as Saint Cecilia was pierced by three
wounds, so she might be pierced with the three wounds of
contrition, compassion, and eager longing towards God. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>first two desires she forgot for a while; but the three wounds
she prayed for continually. When she was thirty years old,
the gift of sickness was granted her, and it was exactly such
a sickness, “so hard as unto death,” as she had asked: a
fact which tells us a good deal about Julian’s mental make-up,
revealing her as the possessor of an extremely active “psychic
background.” By the law of association we may be sure that
her illness brought back to mind the other forgotten prayer,
for a deeper insight into, and vision of, the Passion. It is
supposed that she was at this time already an anchoress, shut
in that tiny room against the south wall of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Julian’s church
at Norwich, of which the foundations can still be traced.
But nothing in her own account suggests this, and the presence
of her mother and “other persons” round her sick bed is
rather against it. At the same time, a single woman of strong
religious bent is hardly likely in that period to have remained
in the world till she was thirty. Julian was perhaps a Benedictine
nun at Carrow, and after her vision sought a life of
greater seclusion and austerity at <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Julian’s, which was the
property of the Carrow convent. The anchoress was often,
but not always, a professed nun: and though no reminiscences
of cloister life can be traced in Julian’s writings, such a life
would account in part for the theological knowledge and
familiarity with dogmatic language which those writings
display.</p>

<p class='c005'>Julian’s account of what happened in her illness is extremely
precise, and makes this part of her revelation an interesting
psychological document. She fell ill early in May 1373;
and on the fourth night was thought to be dying and given
the last sacraments. For two days more she lingered, quite
conscious and expecting death; and early in the morning of
the third day, lost all feeling in her lower limbs. When the
priest came to help her agony she was already speechless;
but made her nurses prop her upright in bed, so that she could
fix her failing eyes on the crucifix he held towards her. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>she could see, though everything else grew dim to her sight.
Then her head fell on one side, breath failed, and she was sure
that the end had come.</p>

<p class='c005'>With this conviction and acceptance of death, the stress of
the involuntary struggle for life seems suddenly to have ended.
She had passed into a new state of consciousness, in which
her mind was clear and her body free of pain, “as whole as
ever before or after.” In this condition her old and forgotten
desires came back into her mind. The first, for sickness,
had been granted. Now, she was impelled to ask the other,
for a keener realization of the Passion; and this buried wish,
surging back abruptly into consciousness, became the starting-point
of her mystical experiences. We cannot deny that
these experiences had their pathological side. Her physical
and psychic state were abnormal. With the perfect candour
and common sense which add so much to our delight in her,
she confesses that she at first mistook her revelations for
delirium, and said to the monk who afterwards visited her that
she had raved. There are, however, in these revelations, as
in all visionary experience of any value, two distinct sides.
One is the visual or auditory hallucination—the vision seen,
the voice heard—the materials for which clearly come from
the unconscious mind of the visionary, and can generally be
traced to their source. The other is the intuitive spiritual
teaching that accompanies it, and often far exceeds the
visionary’s own knowledge or power. Julian, in her account
of what happened to her, keeps these two elements perfectly
distinct. “All the blessed teaching of our Lord God,” she
says, “was shown to me by three parts—that is to say, by
the bodily sight, by words formed in mine understanding, and
by ghostly sight.”</p>

<p class='c005'>The bodily vision, as she expressly affirms, she did not ask
for; and here she agrees with all true mystics, who invariably
distrust these quasi-physical experiences. Yet it was in such
visionary hallucination that her revelations began. With her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>eyes still fixed on the crucifix, and apparently at the point
of death, she suddenly saw red blood running down from the
Crown of Thorns, as if in answer to her prayer for more feeling
of the Passion of Christ. The Cross had become for her, as
the shining pewter dish did for Jacob Boehme, or the running
stream for <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius, a focal point on which to concentrate;
and so a door to a deeper state of consciousness. Spiritual
insight went side by side with the bodily vision, which was
accepted without question by Julian as a direct message
from Christ to strengthen her, “lest she be tempted of fiends
before she died”; for in spite of her intuitive philosophic sense,
we must remember that she lived in imagination in that Gothic
world of concrete devils and angels which the cathedral
sculptors reproduced. The double experience—outward
pictures of the Passion, and inward teachings of the nature
of God—continued for five hours, whilst she lay in a state of
trance which her mother mistook for death. “The first began
early in the morn, about the hour of four; and they lasted,
showing by process full fair and steadily, each following other,
till it was nine of the day overpassed.” In those five hours
Julian received the whole substance of her teaching, afterwards
divided by her into sixteen “revelations of love.”
When they had passed, normal consciousness returned, or,
as she says, she “fell to herself,” and knew that she must live.
She lay for some time in weakness and depression, tormented
by evil dreams; but she recovered from her sickness,
and lived to a great age. Her careful account of that illness,
and of the psychic experiences accompanying it, helps us to
understand those experiences from the psychological as well
as the mystical point of view. Seen thus, they are not unique;
but classic examples of a type which turns up from time to
time in medical history. Thus Dr. Edwin Ash, in <i>Faith and
Suggestion</i>, has described a case which strikingly resembles
that of Julian. Here, too, at the crisis of an apparently hopeless
illness, the patient fell into a death-like trance, had visions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>of a religious type, and emerged cured. Her mind was far
inferior to that of Julian, hence her experience had less
beauty and significance and was of little value for other souls.
Nevertheless, its general outline forces us to acknowledge that
it belongs to the same class, and helps us to interpret the facts
which lie behind Julian’s words.</p>

<p class='c005'>Julian’s revelations have come down to us in two distinct
versions, which have both been edited for modern readers.
The best known is the long version, reproduced in Miss
Warrack’s delightful edition: but our earliest manuscript
of this only goes back to the sixteenth century, at least a
hundred years after Julian’s death. Another, much shorter,
is found in one fifteenth-century manuscript in the British
Museum, and this has been edited by Mr. Dundas Herford,
who claims—I think with good reason—that it represents
Julian’s first account of her visions, written or told while they
were still fresh in her mind, and before her memory of them
had been coloured by long meditation, or by the theological
learning which she certainly acquired in later life. It briefly
sets forth her chain of visions, and the “ghostly words” and
inward teachings that accompanied them. These, she says,
she has set down for the help of her fellow-Christians and
because she saw it to be God’s will. “But,” she adds, “God
forbid that ye should say or take it so, that I am a teacher:
for I mean not so! No! I never meant so! For I am a
woman, unlearned, feeble and frail; but I know well that this
that I say, I have it of the showing of Him that is Sovereign
Teacher.” In the long version these deprecatory words are
omitted. Julian no longer fears to be regarded as a teacher.
On the contrary, she speaks with a gentle authority as one
whose position is assured. She is now, without doubt, the
established anchoress; the devout woman whose special
vocation is known, and to whom people come for spiritual
teaching. Moreover, she tells us in this book that only twenty
years, less three months, after her vision was she inwardly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>taught the importance of all its details, however “misty and
indifferent” they seemed. She was therefore past fifty when
she wrote or dictated it; and it contains the fruit, not only of
her first vivid experience, but of all the ponderings by which
the last atom of significance was extracted from it, the
“enlightenings and touchings of the same Spirit,” which kept
the revelation fresh in after life.</p>

<p class='c005'>As she says herself—for her introspective powers were
remarkable—the “first beginnings” and subsequent “ghostly
teachings” at last became so merged in her understanding
that she could not separate them. There is a parallel to this
in the life of Boehme. He says that in the abnormal state
which was induced by gazing at the polished pewter dish he
“understood the Being of all Beings”—even as Julian “saw
God in a Point”—but this stupendous revelation only left
him dazed and inarticulate. Only after twelve years of meditation,
during which he felt the seed of truth “unfolding within
him like a young plant,” was he able to describe it.</p>

<p class='c005'>When we compare the two versions of Julian’s work, we
find many differences which remind us of this confession.
Although the whole doctrine of the long book is really implied
in the short book—for it is, in Boehme’s phrase, an unfolding
of the plant from that one seed—we see that the most beautiful
and poetical passages are found in the long version only.
They are the fruit of meditation upon vision. The workings
of Julian’s unconscious mind in her trance have only provided
the raw material, as the inspiration of the poet gives only the
crude beginnings of the poem. Moreover, with age her
character deepened and grew richer. She used her talent to
help other souls, and it increased. She studied, too, and found
language of great subtlety and beauty in which to express
her vision of truth. Though even the first version of her book
shows theological knowledge which would put to shame most
present-day Christians, in the later work this knowledge is
much increased. Reading was part of the duty of an anchoress,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>being regarded as an essential element in the life of prayer;
and intelligent reading has clearly nourished Julian’s deep
meditations on the character of God. In her there was an
almost perfect balance between the intellectual and the
emotional life, and there are few women mystics of Whom
we can say this.</p>

<p class='c005'>The question of her literary sources is an interesting one.
A careful examination of her revelations makes it plain that
even when the short version was written, she was already
acquainted with many theological conceptions; whilst the
meditations with which the long version is enriched, and its
fuller descriptions of her spiritual “Showings,” reveal her as
possessing at least by middle life a considerable knowledge of
the language of Augustinian theology and of the root-ideas
of Christian mysticism. As used by her, many of these ideas
have the special colour which was given to them by Meister
Eckhart and his school; and suggest that Julian at one time
or another had come into contact with the characteristically
Dominican type of mysticism which is best known to us in
the works of Suso and Tauler. In her teaching on sin—“I
saw not sin, for I believe it hath no substance nor any part
of being”—she is following, indeed almost quoting, Eckhart’s
saying that “evil is nothing but a privation of being; not an
effect, but a defect.” So, too, Eckhart’s daring assertion that
sin has its place in the scheme—“Since God, in a way, also
wills that I should have committed sins, I do not wish not to
have committed them”—appears to be echoed in gentler form
in Julian’s view of sin as a purifying scourge, and of the scars
which it leaves on the redeemed soul as being “not wounds
but worships.” Her beautiful saying that we are God’s bliss,
“for in us He enjoyeth without end,” seems like a deduction
from the Eckhartian paradox, “God needs me as much as I
need Him.” She has received, perhaps from the same source,
the antique mystical notion of the soul’s precession from and
return to God. “The soul,” said Eckhart, “is created that it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>may flow back into the bottom of the bottomless fountain
whence it came forth.” “Thus I understood,” says Julian,
“that all His blessed children which be come out of Him by
nature shall be brought again into Him by grace”; and
again, “all kinds that He hath made to flow out of Him to
work His will shall be restored and brought again into Him.”
Here, again, the naked Eckhartian monism seems to be transmitted
through a more human and more spiritual temperament.
She agrees, too, with the German mystics in her
doctrine of God as the “ground of the soul.” “Our soul is
so deep-grounded in God and so endlessly treasured that we
may not come to the knowing thereof till we have first knowing
of God.... God is nearer to us than our own soul, for
He is the ground in whom our soul standeth, and He is the
mean that keepeth the substance and the sensuality together
so that they shall never depart.” So Tauler says, “A man
who verily desires to enter in will surely find God here, for
God never separates Himself from this ground. God will be
present with him and he will find and enjoy eternity here.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Julian’s revelation was received in 1373, and the long text
as we have it was written at some date after 1393. Eckhart
had died in 1329, Tauler in 1361; and the great Ruysbroeck,
whose mysticism owes much on its speculative side to Eckhart’s
philosophy, in 1381. The influence of their teaching spread
rapidly, and few preaching friars of an inward disposition
can have escaped it. To these preaching friars was committed
in the fourteenth century the special duty of giving solid
theological teaching to nuns. This was commonly done by
way of vernacular sermons and instructions, of which Tauler’s
surviving sermons are types: and it was possibly through
such instructions given in the Carrow convent that Julian
obtained that peculiar knowledge of Dominican mysticism,
those contacts with Augustinian and Victorine thought, on
which the more philosophic side of her revelation seems to
depend. The parallels with her great contemporary <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>Catherine of Siena, which Professor Edmund Gardner has noted,
are probably due to the fact that both women drew their ideas
from some earlier source. Her likenesses to Ruysbroeck can
also be accounted for. His <i>Seven Cloisters</i>, <i>Kingdom of
God’s Lovers</i>, and <i>Ornaments of the Spiritual Marriage</i> were all
completed before 1350, and knowledge of them would reach
East Anglia quickly, through the Flemish colony established
at Norwich. Several close correspondences with him can be
traced in Julian’s work; especially her conception of God’s
eternal thirst and love-longing, so similar to Ruysbroeck’s
“hungry yet generous love of God,” and the opening phrase
of her Third Revelation, “After this I saw God in a Point,”
which reminds us of the great definition in the <i>Seven Cloisters</i>,
“That Point in which all our lives find their end.” Julian
thus represents the first emergence in English literature of a
stream of tradition which is not represented in the classic
school of English mysticism descended from Rolle. By this
school she does not appear to have been greatly influenced;
there is little in her that reminds us of it, or of that group of
contemplatives who produced the <i>Cloud of Unknowing</i> and its
companion works. Her true affinities are with the Christian
Platonism which <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Augustine introduced into theology, and
its developments in the works of Erigena and Eckhart. But
when we have given full weight to the effects upon her work of
oral teaching and of reading, the true originality of that work
only becomes more manifest. Reading and teaching fed her
speculative mind, and helped her to understand and express
her own experience; but this experience in its essence was
independent of intellectual knowledge. It was the fruit of a
deeply mystical and poetic nature, brooding on the conception
of God common to mediæval Christianity. Julian had
in a high degree constructive religious genius; and for such a
nature an evocative phrase is enough to waken the “ghostly
sight.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It is impossible in a short essay to give any full account of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>her teaching. That teaching is centred on her own ardent
consciousness of God, as an all-transcending yet all-enclosing
reality; a conception at once philosophic and practical. For
Julian, as for the Platonists, God is the sum of the highest
spiritual values—“He is all-thing that is good to my seeming,
and all-thing that is good, it is He.” Her perception of the
Divine Immanence is peculiarly intense, and expressed in the
strongest terms. “God is kind (nature) in His being: that
is to say, that goodness that is in kind, that is God. He is
the ground, He is the substance, He is the same thing that is
kind-head,” and again, “I saw full assuredly that our substance
is in God, and also I saw that in our sensuality God
is ... for it is His good pleasure to reign in our understanding
blissfully, and sit in our soul restfully, and to dwell
in our soul endlessly, us all working into Him.” But this
vivid sense of Divine reality, as the very ground of being, is
closely bound up with her devotion to the person of Christ.
Her theological path, like her mystical experience, lay through
the human to the Divine, through emotional realization of
the Passion to intellectual vision of the Godhead. In the
first revelation of all we get these two aspects of truth sharply
contrasted; for there her vision of the bloodstained Crown
of Thorns, with its intimate appeal to the heart, is balanced
by her other interior sight of “the Godhead seen in mine
understanding.” The long version of her book elaborates
this simple intuition of the Deity into a very beautiful description
of the Holy Trinity—always one of Julian’s favourite
subjects—but the whole is really implied in the first brief
statement, which strikes at once her characteristic chord of
intimacy and awe, or, as she puts it, “the dread and the
homeliness of God.” In the Catholic doctrine of the Trinity,
which was never far from her thoughts, she found the link
between these personal and impersonal apprehensions. That
half-Platonic notion of Christ the Eternal Wisdom as “Mother”
of the soul, which is one of her most original conceptions, here
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>takes its place side by side with the other, more metaphysical
intuition of that unconditioned Deity in whom “All-thing hath
the Being.” “For all our life is in three: in the first we
have our being, in the second we have our increasing, and in the
third we have our fulfilling: the first is nature, the second is
mercy, and the third is grace. For the first I understood that
the high might of the Trinity is our Father, and the deep
wisdom of the Trinity is our Mother, and the great love of the
Trinity is our Lord: and all this we have in nature and in our
substantial making.... All the fair working, and all the
sweet kindly office of dearworthy motherhood is impropriated
to the Second Person ... and all is one Love.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This blend of personal and metaphysical vision is not
unique. We find it again in the Franciscan contemplative,
Angela of Foligno. But Julian’s nature is richer and more
mellow, and the doctrine of love which she deduced from her
experience is more profound. Here, in this harmonized consciousness
of the most human and most philosophic aspects
of religious experience, she is typical of Christian mysticism
at its best. She avoids on the one hand the excessive intellectualism
of the Neoplatonist, and on the other the unpleasant
exuberance of the religious emotionalist, yet draws from the
apprehensions of both the heart and the head all the elements
needed to feed a full spiritual life. The human element
brought in by Christianity, with all the emotional values
belonging to it—however symbolic this side of contemplation
must necessarily be—redeems philosophic mysticism
from the clear coldness, the lofty superiority, that <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Augustine
condemned in the Platonists. But, equally, it is the philosophic
background, the austere worship of that trinity of Light, Life,
and Love, in whom, as Julian says, we are clad more closely
than a body in its clothes, which saves mystical fervour from
its worst extravagances. Here she is and will ever be one of
the safest guides to the contemplative life.</p>

<p class='c005'>Another special quality of Julian’s teaching is its healthy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>vigorous, affirmative character. The only two sins she sternly
condemns—and she calls them not sins, but sickness—are
sloth or lack of zest, and doubtful dread or lack of hope. Zest
and hope she regards as essential factors in the life of the soul.
The Light, Life, and Love which form her ultimate definition
of triune Reality—the Mother, Brother, and Saviour, which are
her nearest images for Christ’s relation with man—these are
conceptions which kill the sort of pious moods that R. L.
Stevenson called “dim, dem, and dowie.” God’s attitude to
man is “courteous, glad, and merry,” and we do Him less
honour by solemnity than by “cheer of mirth and joy.” To
her, only the good is the true, and evil is a void, a lack of the
only reality; a Platonic notion which has always been dear
to the mystics. “In this naked word Sin,” says Julian, “our
Lord brought to my mind generally all that is not good ...
but I saw not sin, for I believe it hath no manner of substance
nor no part of being, nor could it be known but by the pain
it is cause of.” It follows that our attention should not be
given to the avoidance or consideration of sin, but to the
understanding and enjoyment of the good and the real.
“The beholding of other men’s sins, it maketh as it were a
thick mist before the eyes of the soul,” says Julian. Her
strongest condemnation is given to morbid pondering of past
sins and mistakes. “Right as by the courtesy of God He
forgets our sins when we repent, right so will He that we forget
our sin, and all our heaviness and all our doubtful dreads.”
This world, after all, is only a nursery for heaven, and its
inhabitants mostly spiritual babies who need not be taken
too seriously. “I understood no higher stature in this life
than childhood;” and the attitude of God to our infant souls
is that of “the kindly loving Mother that witteth and knoweth
the need of her child and keepeth it full tenderly as the kind
and condition of Motherhood will.”</p>

<p class='c005'>No modern psychologist could be more emphatic than this
fourteenth-century recluse on the foolishness of worry, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>duty of confidence, gaiety, and hope. “Notwithstanding our
simple living and our blindness here, yet endlessly our courteous
Lord beholdeth us in this working rejoicing; and of all
things we may please him best, wisely and truly to believe,
and to enjoy with Him and in Him.” She brings back the
primitive Christian insistence on joy—confident happiness—as
the one sure sign of the spiritual life. If we have not got
this, it is because we lack the faith and common sense which
sees life in a universal and disinterested light. Once, Julian
says, she was inclined to worry about God’s work in the soul
of a friend whom she loved, and she was answered in her
reason “as it were by a friendly man,” “Take it generally!
and behold the courtesy of thy Lord God as He shows it to
thee, for it is more worship to God to behold Him in all than
in any special thing.” In those words we have a complete
prescription for happiness and inward peace. All that is
made, as Julian saw in her vision, is but “a little thing the
quantity of an hazel nut” in comparison with the Divine life
that creates, keeps, and loves it, and may be known in those
sudden glimpses of perfection which we call the Good, the
Beautiful, and the True. These, in her language, are “God’s
courteous showings of Himself,” and we are most likely to
encounter them when we take the worlds of nature and
grace “generally,” and refrain from partial or egoistic
criticisms and demands. Failure in this simple rule, she thinks,
is the true cause of human misery and unrest. “This is the
cause why we be not all in ease of heart and soul; that we
seek here rest in those things that are so little, wherein is no
rest, and know not our God that is All-mighty, All-wise, and
All-good.”</p>

  <h2 id='chap09' class='c004'>MYSTICISM IN MODERN FRANCE</h2>
</div>
<h3 id='chap09-a' class='c010'><abbr title='one'>I</abbr> <br> SŒUR THÉRÈSE DE L’ENFANT-JÉSUS</h3>
<p class='c003'>That Christian tradition of the spiritual life which has
been specially developed within the religious orders—with
its definite objective, its methodical training in self-conquest
and the art of prayer—is often regarded as a mere survival
of mediævalism, lingering in odd corners but having no points
of contact with our modern world. Yet this tradition lives
now, as surely as in the days of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Gertrude or <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Teresa.
It continues to exercise its mysterious attraction; transmuting
those who give themselves to its influence, and producing
that special type of character and experience which
is so clearly marked in the histories of the Catholic saints.
In a world of change, this has hardly altered. Within the
contemplative convents there obtains that same scale of
values, that same contempt for the body and undivided
attention to the interests of the soul, that same avoidance of
all comfort or pleasure and eager acceptance of pain, which
is revealed in the standard writings of Christian asceticism.
In these houses, mysticism is still a practical art: the education
there given represents the classic spiritual discipline of
the west, and still retains its transforming power. Through
it, souls obtain access to a veritable world of spirit; and
apprehend under symbols eternal values, which are unperceived
by their fellow men. By it they are supported through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>the difficult adjustments of consciousness and sublimation
of instinct, which are needed when the centre of life’s interest
is shifted from physical to supernal levels. This is a fact
which students of psychology, and especially of religious
experience in its intensive form, should not ignore. They
need not go to the Middle Ages for their examples of the effect
of ascetic training and contemplative practice, or for characteristic
specimens of the “saintly type”; for these may be found
within our own period, and studied in their relation to our
modern world.</p>

<p class='c005'>Those who regard this saintly type as a hot-house plant,
raised under conditions which appear to defend it from the
temptations and distractions of ordinary existence, can have
little acquaintance either with cloister ideals or with cloistered
lives. A thoroughgoing monastic discipline is the most
searching school of virtue ever invented. It withers easy-going
piety and “other-worldliness” at the root. It confers
a robust humility which is proof against all mortifications
and disappointments. It leaves no room for individual tastes
and preferences, religious or secular. Its pupils must learn
to resent nothing, to demand nothing; to thrive on humiliations,
to love and serve all without distinction, without
personal choice; even to renounce the special consolations
of religion. The common idea of the cloister, as providing
a career of impressive religious ceremonial varied by plain
sewing, pious gossip, and “devotionettes” is far from the
truth. On its external side, a well-ordered convent provides
a busy, practical, family life of the most austere kind, with
many duties, both religious and domestic, countless demands
upon patience, good-temper and unselfishness, and few
relaxations. On its hidden side, it is a device to train and
toughen the spirit, develop its highest powers, and help it to
concentrate its attention more and more completely on
eternal realities. That training is still given in its completeness;
and the classic, saintly character is still being produced,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>with its special cultivation of love, meekness, and self-sacrifice,
balanced by energy, courage, and strength of will.</p>

<p class='c005'>Sanctity is the orientation of the spirit towards supreme
Reality. To the believer in any theistic religion, no attitude
of the soul could be simpler, more natural than this. There
is nothing about it which deserves to be called abnormal,
archaic, or fantastic. The complications with which it is
surrounded, the unnatural aspect which it wears for practical
men, all come from its collision with the entangled interests
and perverse ideals of the world. Thus, retreat from this
tangle of sham interests, the building up of a consistent
universe within which the self can develop its highest powers
and purest loves, is felt to be imperative for those selves in
whom this innate aptitude for God reaches the conscious
level. In these spirits, the “vocation” for the special life
of correspondence with the supersensual reproduces on a
higher plane the vocation of the artist or the poet. All the
self’s best energies and desires tend in this direction, and it
will achieve harmonious development only by unifying itself
about this centre of interest, and submitting to the nurture
and discipline which shall assure its dominance. The symbols
with which the universe of religion is furnished, the moral
law which there obtains, are all contributory to the one end;
and find their justification in its achievement.</p>

<p class='c005'>Within the Christian Church, and especially in that which
is technically called the “religious life,” these symbols and
this law have not varied for many centuries; nor has the type
of personality which they develop changed much since it
first appeared in monastic history. The sharp sense of close
communion with, and immediate responsibility to, a personal
God possessing human attributes; the complete abandonment
of desire, combined with astonishing tenacity of purpose;
contempt for the merely comfortable either in spiritual or
physical affairs; a glad and eager acceptance of pain—these
are the qualities of the Christian saint, and these are still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>fostered in appropriate subjects by the cloistered life. These
facts have been abundantly demonstrated during the last
thirty years in a group of French Carmelite mystics, of whom
the best known is Thérèse Martin, already the object of a
widespread <i>cultus</i> under the name of Sœur Thérése de l’Enfant
Jésus. Others who will repay study are Elizabeth Catez,
or Sœur Elizabeth de la Trinité (1880-1906) and Mère Marie-Ange
de l’Enfant-Jésus (1881-1909). It is clear that we have
in these young women—for they all died before they were
thirty years of age—a genuine renaissance of traditional
Catholic mysticism. Their experience exhibits many close
correspondences with that of the great mystics of the past;
the same development of the interior life can be traced in
them, and they knew at first hand some at least among those
forms of spiritual consciousness which are described by
Ruysbroeck, Angela of Foligno, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Teresa, and <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John of
the Cross.</p>

<p class='c005'>The first in time and in importance—for the others depended
to a greater or less degree on her influence and example—was
Thérèse Martin, who was born at Alençon in 1873 and died
in 1897. The last nine years of her life were spent in the
Carmelite Convent of Lisieux in Normandy; and she there
wrote the spiritual autobiography, <i>L’histoire d’une âme</i>, which
has since been translated into every European language. In
her life—which shows with exceptional clearness the reality
and driving power of that instinct which is known as religious
vocation—and in the incidents connected with her death and
<i>cultus</i>, we find many suggestive parallels with the histories
of the historical saints. These parallels often help us to determine
the true meaning of statements in those histories;
indicating the possible origin of much that now appears
extravagant and abnormal, and restoring to their real position
in the human race men and women who dropped their
living characteristics in ascending to the altars of the
Church.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>We notice first in Thérèse the extent to which heredity and
environment contributed to the formation in her of an
exclusively religious temperament. She inherited from both
parents an ascetic tendency. Her father, as a young man, had
sought without success to become a novice at the Great
St. Bernard; her mother had wished to be a Sister of Charity.
Their marriage had the character of a religious dedication;
and their one wish was for children who might be consecrated
to the service of God. Nine were born, of whom four died in
infancy. The five girls who survived all entered the cloister,
for which indeed their whole life had been a perfect preparation.
The idea of marriage seems never to have occurred to
any member of the family. Hence Thérèse, the youngest
child, grew up in a home which was a veritable forcing-house
of the spiritual life, though full of happiness and warm affection;
and by it was moulded to that puritanism and other-worldliness
which is characteristic of real Catholic piety.
There the conception of earthly existence as a “school for
saints” was taken for granted, and the supremacy of religious
interests never questioned: all deeds and words, however
trivial, being judged by the grief or pleasure they would give
to God. Even as a tiny child, she was given a string of beads
to count the “sacrifices” made each day. The Martin
family lived, in fact, within a dream-world, substantially
identical with the universe of mediæval piety. It was peopled
with angels and demons, whose activities were constantly
noted; its doors were ever open for the entry of the miraculous,
its human inhabitants were the objects of the Blessed Virgin’s
peculiar care, every chance happening was the result of
Divine interference. For them this universe was actual, not
symbolic. Their minds instinctively rejected every impression
that conflicted with it; and its inconsistencies with the
other—perhaps equally symbolic and less lovely—world of
our daily life were unperceived. The most bizarre legends
of the saints were literal facts; all relics were authentic, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>most were full of supernatural power. The Holy House of
Loretto, the face of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Catherine of Bologna still marked
by the kiss of the Infant Christ, found in them willing and
awestruck believers. Yet these crude symbols, thus literally
understood, became for them the means of a real transcendence.
The dominant interests of the home were truly
supersensual; a vigorous spiritual life was fostered in it,
marked by humility and love, true goodness, complete unselfishness,
a courageous attitude towards misfortune and
pain.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus from birth Thérèse was protected from all risk of
intellectual conflict, and surrounded by harmonious contributory
suggestions all tending to press her emotional life into
one mould. Such a nurture could hardly fail to create either
the disposition of a rebel or that of a saint: but there was in
Thérèse no tendency to revolt. Her temperament—ardent,
imaginative, abnormally sensitive, and psychically unstable—inclined
her to the enthusiastic acceptance of religious ideas,
and even in childhood she showed a fervour and devotion
exceeding that of her sisters. When she was still a little girl,
the two eldest left home one after the other, in order to become
nuns in the Carmelite convent of Lisieux. The departure of
the first, Pauline, was a crushing grief to Thérèse, at that time
about nine years old; and was apparently the beginning of
her own desire to be a nun. She told the Superior of the
convent that she, too, intended to be a Carmelite, and wished
to take the veil at once. The Reverend Mother, a woman of
kindness and good sense, did not laugh; but advised her to
wait until she was sixteen, and then to try her vocation.
There is less absurdity than at first appears in this childish
craving; for the religious type is often strangely precocious.
As the tendency to music or painting may appear in earliest
childhood, so the sense of vocation may awaken, long before
the implications of this mysterious impulse are fully understood.
Thus Elizabeth Catez, afterwards Sœur Elizabeth de
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>la Trinité, determined to be a nun when she was seven years
old, and began at this age to govern her inner life. She and
Thérèse help us to understand the stories and the visions
and self-dedication of the little <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Catherine of Siena; or
those of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Catherine of Genoa and Madame Guyon, who
both wished at twelve years old to enter a religious order.
We are faced in all such cases by the strange phenomenon of
accelerated development: strongly marked in the case of
Thérèse, who undoubtedly had, in spite of the great
simplicity of her nature, a real genius for the spiritual
life.</p>

<p class='c005'>She had, too, and in a marked degree, the peculiarly sensitive
psychic organization which is observed in many of the
historic mystics. A long and severe nervous illness had followed
her sister’s departure for the cloister. It was cured
by a form of auto-suggestion for which many parallels can be
found in the history of adult religious experience; though
few in that of children of her age. This incident Thérèse has
described in her memoirs with great clearness and honesty.
At a crisis of the sickness, when she was reduced to utter
misery and weakness and tormented by hallucinations and
fears, her three sisters came to her room and knelt before
the statue of the Blessed Virgin, praying for her cure. The
sick child, praying too as well as she could, suddenly saw
the statue take life and advance towards her with a smile.
Instantly the prayer was answered, her pains and delusions
left her, and she was cured. The “vision” being told—and
of course accepted at face-value as a supernatural grace—marked
Thérèse from this time as a privileged soul. It certainly
indicated in her an abnormal suggestibility, comparable
with that which is revealed by the somewhat similar incident
in the life of Julian of Norwich, and was not without importance
for her future development.</p>

<p class='c005'>The religious transformation and exaltation so often
experienced in adolescence is seen in Thérèse in its most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>intense form. It was initiated when she was thirteen by
another nervous illness, apparently brought on by a morbid
brooding on her own supposed imperfections—the spiritual
ailment well known to religious directors as “scrupulosity”—and
it was from this period that she afterwards dated the
beginning of her real spiritual life. The childish determination
to become a Carmelite had now grown in strength, and
when she was fourteen she broke to her father her own violent
consciousness of vocation; a certitude which nothing could
shake. Her inner life was at this time astonishingly mature.
She was not a prig, but a sensitive and affectionate little girl;
yet her autobiography is full of sayings which surprise us by
their depth and wisdom, when we remember the age of the
child who thought and said them. By the constant practice
of small renunciations, self-denial was now habitual to her;
for it was by that which she called the “little pathway” of
incessant but inconspicuous sacrifices and kind deeds, and
not by any abnormal austerities or devotions, that her character
was formed. Though perfectly free from all spiritual pride,
she was, moreover, quite certain of her own communion with
the Divine order, and of the authority of the impressions which
she received from it.</p>

<p class='c005'>“En ce temps-là, je n’osais rien dire de mes sentiments
intérieurs; la voie par laquelle je marchais était si droite, si
lumineuse, que je ne sentais pas le besoin d’un autre guide
que Jésus ... je pensais que pour moi, le bon Dieu ne se
servait pas d’intermédiaire, mais agissait directement.”</p>

<p class='c005'>These are bold words for a young girl who had been reared
in the most rigid provincial piety, and had been taught to
distrust private judgment and regard her director as the
representative of God. In them we see the action of that
strong will, power of initiative and clear conception of her
own needs and duties, which redeem her often emotional
religious fervour from insipidity. It is true that she can and
does express that fervour in the sentimental language which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>is the least attractive element in French piety. The sense of
a special relationship and special destiny which more and more
possessed her, far exceeded her powers either of realization
or of expression; and unfortunately impelled her to describe
herself as the “fleurette,” the “petite fiancée,” even the
“jouet” of Jesus, and to note in too many casual happenings
evidence of “les delicatesses du bon Dieu pour moi.” Yet we
cannot forget that similar declarations, equally offensive to
modern taste, abound in some of the greatest historical mystics,
and that their full unpleasantness is only mitigated to us by
the quaint and archaic phrases in which they are expressed.
Whilst no doubt these declarations represent the invasion of
human desires and instincts into the field of spiritual experience,
its natural craving for protection and personal love;
they also witness to the mystic’s intense personal consciousness
of close communion, a consciousness which far transcends
the poor vocabulary and commonplace symbols through which
it must be told.</p>

<p class='c005'>Therefore we cannot dismiss Thérèse Martin as a mere
victim of religious emotionalism, because her mental equipment
is inadequate to her spiritual experience. When, moreover,
we remember the amazing vigour and tenacity of purpose
with which, when barely fifteen, this gentle and home-loving
child, driven by her strong sense of vocation, planned and
carried through a lifelong separation from the father she
adored and the world of nature she loved, we are bound to
acknowledge in her an element of greatness, a strong and an
adventurous soul. With a certitude of her own duty which
nothing could shake, Thérèse interviewed on her own behalf
the Superior of the order, who snubbed her, and the Bishop
of the diocese, who was kind but prevaricated with her;
demanding from them permission to take the veil at once,
instead of waiting till the usual age of twenty-one. Further,
being taken by her father to Rome with a party of French
pilgrims, when they were all received by the Pope she had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>the courage to address him directly—although the priest in
charge of the pilgrimage forbade it—and asked for his support.
The end of it was that she at last convinced the authorities
of her special vocation, and was allowed to become a postulant
in the most austere of all religious orders at the unheard-of
age of fifteen.</p>

<p class='c005'>Her career as a Carmelite was far from being the succession
of mystical enjoyments, the basking in divine sunshine, which
some imagine the contemplative life to be. She now experienced
the common lot of the “proficient” in the mystic
way; paying for her religious exaltation by reactions, long
periods of aridity, which were doubtless due in part to psychic
exhaustion. Then, in addition to the perpetual little sacrifices,
self-deprivations, and penances which she imposed on herself,
she seemed, as she says, to be plunged in a “terrible desert,”
a “profound night” of darkness and solitude; and prayer
itself became dreary and unreal. “Tout a disparu ...
ce n’est plus un voile, c’est un mur qui s’éleve jusqu’aux
cieux et couvre le firmament étoilé.” But an inner life
which was nourished on the robust doctrine of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John of the
Cross could bear this deprivation with fortitude, and make
of inward poverty itself a gain. Outwardly, too, her life was
difficult. Her superiors seem at once to have perceived in her
that peculiar quality of soul which is capable of sanctity;
and since it is the ambition of every community to produce
a saint, they addressed themselves with vigour to the stern
task of educating Thérèse for her destiny. Still a child,
sensitive and physically delicate, she was spared no opportunity
of self-denial and mortification. Her most trifling
deficiencies were remarked, her most reasonable desires
thwarted, her good points ignored. When her health began
to fail under a rule of life far beyond her strength, and the
first signs of tuberculosis—that scourge of the cloister—appeared
in her, the Prioress, in her ferocious zeal for souls,
even refused to dispense the ailing girl from attendance at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>the night-office. “Une âme de cette trempe, disait-elle, ne
doit pas être traité comme une enfant, les dispenses ne sont
pas faites pour elle. Laissez-la. Dieu la soutient.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This drastic training did its work. Thérèse had a heroic
soul, though her courage and generosity found expression
for the most part in small and obscure ways. She has said
that she felt in herself the longing to be a soldier, an apostle,
a martyr; and within the limits of the cloister, she found
means of satisfying these desires. “Elle accomplissait simplement
des actes héroïques,” said the Superior after her death.
Determined, in her own metaphor, to be a “victime d’amour,”
her brave spirit never faltered in its willing acceptance of pain.
She hid her mental and physical sufferings, fought her increasing
weakness, ate without hesitation the rough food which
made her ill, refused every comfort and amelioration. By
this hard yet humble way she rose in a few years to the
heights of perfect self-conquest and moral perfection: passing
through suffering to a state in which love, and total self-giving
for love, was realized by her as the central secret
of the spiritual life. “La charité me donna la clef de
ma vocation.... Enfin, je l’ai trouvée. Ma vocation, c’est
l’amour.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In this completed love, stretching from the smallest
acts of service to the most secret experiences of the soul,
she found—as every mystic has done—that unifying principle
of action which alone gives meaning to life. In its light
all problems were solved, and the meaning of all experiences
was disclosed. So Julian of Norwich, fifteen years after
her first revelation, was answered in ghostly understanding:
“Wouldest thou wit thy Lord’s meaning in this thing? Wit it
well, Love was his meaning. Who showed it thee? Love.
What showed he thee? Love. Wherefore showed it he?
For love. Hold thee therein and thou shalt wit and know more
in the same; but thou shalt never know nor wit therein
other thing without end.” To live in this supernatural charity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>is to introduce into the world of succession the steadfast
values of eternity; hence this quality, so simple yet so difficult
of attainment, is the one essential character of the saints.
“Pour atteindre à la vie idéale de l’âme,” said Elizabeth
Catez, who so greatly exceeded her fellow-Carmelite in philosophic
grasp, though not in moral beauty, “je crois qu’il
faut vivre dans le surnaturel, prendre conscience que Dieu
est au plus intime de nous, et aller à tout avec lui: alors
on n’est jamais banal, même en faisant les actions les plus
ordinaires, car on ne vit pas en ces choses, on les dépasse.
Une âme surnaturelle ne traite pas avec les causes secondes,
mais avec Dieu seulement ... pour elle, tout se reduite à
l’unité.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Thérese de l’Enfant-Jésus came to this consummation by
way of a total and generous self-abandonment in all the daily
incidents of life; a love which consecrated “les actions les
plus ordinaires.” She took as her favourite saint the Curé
d’Ars, because “he loved his family so deeply, and only did
ordinary things.” This was the “little pathway” to the
heart of Reality, on which, she thought, all might travel
and none could miss the road. “Aux âmes simples, il ne
faut pas des moyens compliqués.” Though the unquenchable
thirst of her ardent nature for more suffering and more love
did more than once express itself by way of ecstatic experience,
she repudiated all abnormal “graces” and special contemplative
powers. “Je ne suis qu’un pauvre petit oiseau
couvert seulement d’un léger duvet; je ne suis pas un aigle,
j’en ai simplement les yeux et le cœur.” Her spiritual practice
became simplified as she grew in understanding. In the
last years of her life the Gospels were her only book of devotion,
and her prayer became “un élan du cœur, un simple regard
jeté vers le ciel.” Yet the love thus expressed was no mere
“divine duet.” She was not a victim of that narrow fervour
which finds its satisfaction in a vertical relation with the
Divine; her religion was of a distinctly social type. “Le
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>zêle d’une Carmelite doit embrasser le monde,” she said;
and this zeal showed itself, not only in the passionate love she
gave to her family, but in radiant affection towards all living
beings—the nuns in the convent, some of whom were extremely
tiresome and even unkind, her friends and correspondents in
the outside world, the animals and the birds. She always
had her eye on her fellow-creatures; she wanted to help them,
to show light to them, to save them. The eager service and
voluntary mortifications of her life closed with eighteen
months of great physical suffering. She died in September
1897, at the age of twenty-four.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thérèse Martin had lived for nine years within the walls of
a small, strictly enclosed convent in a provincial town. This
building and its dreary little chapel formed the setting of
her religious career. There was nothing impressive in her
surroundings, nothing to satisfy those artistic instincts which
she certainly possessed, to hint at the poetry and mystery of
the spiritual life. Her opportunities of action had been
limited on every side; her creative impulse found expression
only in the writing of some conventional religious verse, and
the record of her thoughts and experiences, composed not
for publication, but as an act of obedience to her Superior.
Prayer, the teaching of novices, the family life of the community,
and a small amount of correspondence with those in
the world, were the only channels through which her passionate
love of humanity could flow. This record may not sound
impressive. Its sequel is amazing. Students of history have
often discussed the stages and the circumstances through which
a simple man or woman, distinguished only by a beautiful
and humble life, has been transformed by the reverence, love,
and myth-making faculty of his contemporaries into a supernatural
being endowed with magical powers. This transformation
has happened within our own time in the person of
Thérèse de l’Enfant-Jésus. This young girl, whose life was
marked by no bizarre incident, who was brought up in an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>obscure Norman town, and deliberately shut herself up in a
convent of strictest enclosure to remain—as the “healthy-minded”
would say—buried alive till her death, is now loved
and invoked wherever the Roman Catholic church is established.
Her short and uneventful life has influenced and
comforted countless other lives. Her “cause” has been
introduced, and although she is not yet canonized, she is already
regarded as numbered among the saints. To visit her grave
in the beautiful hillside cemetery outside Lisieux, and watch
the endless stream of pilgrims who come on every day of the
year from all parts of the world to ask her help, to deposit
letters explaining their needs, and lay on her tomb for blessing
the clothes of babies or the food of the sick, is to understand
what the shrine of a mediæval saint must have been like. It
is to understand also something of the triumphant power of
character, and of the fact that the enclosing of a radiant personality
within the cloister is not burying it alive.</p>

<p class='c005'>Although the whole of her short adult life had been passed
behind the high garden walls of the convent, and after she
took the veil only the members of her family had seen her—and
this under the most restricted conditions—yet at the time
of her death Thérèse de l’Enfant-Jésus was already known and
valued by the whole town. That death was an event of
importance, evoking an extraordinary demonstration of
affection and reverence. The events which followed it are of
deep interest. Here, in our own day, we have the swift rise
and diffusion of a <i>cultus</i> exactly similar to those which followed
the deaths of the great popular saints of the Middle
Ages. Every element is present; the prompt setting up of a
pilgrimage, the veneration of the tomb, the distribution of
relics—at the Lisieux convent cards are sold, bearing splinters
and bits of straw from the cell of Thérèse—countless reports
of visions, conversions, “supernatural perfumes,” and
miraculous answers to prayer. The literature of the subject
is already considerable, and a journal is published giving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>details of “graces” obtained by her help. The causes which
lie behind such religious movements as this are still obscure;
but we have in the cult of Thérèse Martin a valuable clue by
which to interpret those reported from the past. Her
“miracles,” in which students of psychic phenomena will find
much to interest them, range from the cure of cancer to the
multiplication of bank-notes, and even include the restoration
of dead geranium-cuttings. Many are obviously explained by
coincidence or hallucination, some are admirable examples of
faith-healing. But a few, apparently supported by good
evidence, seem to defy rationalistic explanation.</p>

<p class='c005'>The cult quickly lost its local and ultimately its national
character. Though French Catholicism rightly claims Thérèse
as its peculiar possession, and devotion to her is probably more
general in France than elsewhere, yet she is now venerated
in every country in the world, and distributes her favours
without regard to nationality. Scotland and America in
particular have numerous stories of her benevolent intervention,
at least as evidential as much that is offered to us by the
exponents of spiritualism. Her legend is in active formation,
and many picturesque incidents were added to it during the
war. She is even said to have appeared at the British Headquarters,
and given advice at a critical moment of the campaign.
A large proportion of the Catholic soldiers who fought
for France probably placed themselves under her protection,
and attribute their safety to her care.</p>

<p class='c005'>A little time before her death, she said to her sister Pauline,
“Une seule attente fait battre mon cœur; c’est l’amour que
je recevrai et celui que je pourrai donner.... Je veux passer
mon ciel à faire du bien sur la terre,” and again, “Je compte
bien ne pas rester inactive au ciel, mon désir est de travailler
encore.” In these sayings, so unlike in their vigorous activism
the conventional aspirations of the devout, we have probably
the germinal point of her <i>cultus</i>. It has come to be believed
that this simple and loving spirit, who passed from the body
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>with so many generous longings unfulfilled, is indeed spending
her heaven in doing good; and the deeds attributed to her
are just those practical and friendly acts of kindness, through
which during life she expressed and perfected her spirit of
love.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>
  <h3 id='chap09-b' class='c010'><abbr title='two'>II</abbr> <br> LUCIE-CHRISTINE</h3>
</div>
<p class='c003'>Those students of mysticism who feel that the purely
cloistered type of spirituality, as seen in Thérèse Martin and
Elizabeth Catez, is too remote from the common experience
to be actual to us, may find something with which they can
sympathize and from which they can learn, in the self-revelations
of the remarkable contemplative who is known under
the pseudonym of Lucie-Christine.</p>

<p class='c005'>This lady, whose spiritual journal was published in 1912,
was a married woman of the leisured class, leading the ordinary
life of a person of her type and position. She was born in
1844 and married in 1865. She had five children. At forty-three
she became a widow, and in 1908, after nineteen years
of blindness, she died at the age of sixty-four. Nothing
could have been more commonplace than her external circumstances.
On the religious side she was an exact and fervent
Roman Catholic, accepting without question the dogmas
and discipline of the Church, and diligent in all the outward
observances of conventional French piety. Her time was
spent in family and social duties, sometimes in Paris, sometimes
in her country home; and she appeared to her neighbours
remarkable only for her goodness, gentleness, and love of
religion. Yet her inward life—unsuspected by any but her
parish priest, for whom her journal was written—had a richness
and originality which entitle her to a place among the Catholic
mystics, and often help us to understand the meaning and
character of the parallel experiences which those mystics
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>describe. The value for study of a contemplative who is at
once so modern and so classic is obvious. This value is increased
by the fact that for many years Lucie-Christine knew
nothing of mystical literature, and was ignorant even of
the names of the spiritual states which her journal so faithfully
describes. Therefore in her case unconscious imitation,
which accounts for much so-called mystical experience,
appears to be excluded.</p>

<p class='c005'>Her journal—at present our only source of information—covers
thirty-eight years: from 1870 to 1908. The first
twelve years, however, are only represented by fragmentary
notes, put together in 1882; when Lucie-Christine, at the
suggestion of her confessor, began to keep a detailed record
of her religious life. Whatever view we may take of its
theological value, this record is certainly a psychological
document of the first class. It is the work of a woman of
marked intelligence; temperamentally philosophic, and with
great intuitional gifts. The short memoir prefixed to the
French edition tells us that even as a child she showed unusual
qualities; was grave, thoughtful, and to some extent “psychic,”
being subject to flashes of clairvoyance, and premonitions of
important and tragic events. This peculiarity, which she
disliked and never spoke of, persisted through life; and its
presence in her helps us to understand how the many stories
of abnormal power possessed by the mystics first arose.</p>

<p class='c005'>Her character was by no means of that detached and
inhuman type which is supposed to be proper to religious
exaltation. She was ardent and impressionable, gave love
and craved for it; her qualities and faults were essentially
of a lovable kind. She reveals herself in her journal as
sensitive, idealistic, and affectionate; somewhat unpractical,
very easily wounded, tempted to irritability, and inclined to
worry. “The excessive wish to be loved, appreciated,
admired by those whom I love,” was one of the temptations
against which, as a young woman, she felt it necessary to pray:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>another was the longing for enjoyment, for personal happiness.
It was only after eight years of intermittent mystical experience
that she learned the secret of inward peace: to “lose
her own interests in those of God, and receive a share in His
interests in exchange.” Though the “activity and practical
capacity of Martha” never came naturally to her, she was yet
a splendid wife and mother. Even in the years when her
inner life was passed in almost continuous contemplation, she
never neglected human duties for superhuman joys; but
planned and shared the amusements of her boys and girls,
wrote and rehearsed the plays which they acted, and watched
with care over every detail of their lives.</p>

<p class='c005'>Her spiritual life developed gradually and evenly. There
is no trace in it of any psychic storm or dramatic conversion.
She grew up in a religious home, and even in childhood seems
to have been attracted to silent devotion or “mental prayer.”
As a girl she was a vital, impulsive creature, full of eager
enthusiasms. That deep, instinctive longing for Perfection
which makes one man an artist, another a philosopher, and
another a saint, showed itself early in a passionate worship
of all beautiful things. “Tout ce que je connaissais de beau
me passionnait et entraînait toute mon âme. La première
vue de la mer et des falaises m’arracha des larmes.... Je
ne pouvais trouver l’expression qui traduisît assez l’ardeur
dont le beau enflammait mon imagination, et je ne voyais
pas d’inconvénients à ces entraînements excessifs; au contraire,
je m’y livrais de toute la force de ma volonté. Infortunée,
mon âme en revenait cependant avec le sentiment du vide et
de l’insuffisance, et c’est alors qu’elle rejetait son activité
dévorante sur l’idéal qui lui réservait tant de dangers! Moins
altérée du beau, je me fusse peut-être contentée des choses
réelles, mais comme le coureur, lancé dans un fol élan, dépasse
le but, ainsi mon âme s’élançait vers le beau à peine aperçu
et cherchait encore au delà.”</p>

<p class='c005'>In this important passage we see the true source of Lucie’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>mysticism. It was the craving for an absolute and unchanging
loveliness on which to expend her large-hearted powers of
adoration and self-giving, which led her like the Platonists
through visible beauty to its invisible source. She had, as
she says of herself in a sudden flash of ironic wit, “le cœur
assez mal placé pour trouver Dieu plus aimable que le monde,
et l’esprit assez étroit pour se contenter de l’Infini”; but it was
not until youth was nearly over, and she had been married
for eight years, that she found what she sought. One day,
when she was meditating as usual on a passage in the <i>Imitation
of Christ</i>, she saw and heard within her mind the words
“Dieu seul!”—summing up and answering in one phrase the
vague efforts and questions of her growing mystical sense,
and offering to the hungry psyche the only satisfaction of
desire. As Fox was released from his conflict by the inner
voice which cried, “There is one only who can speak to thy
condition,” so this inner voice, says Lucie (whom it greatly
astonished), “fut à la fois une lumière, un attrait, et une force.
Une lumière qui me fit voir comment je pouvais être complètement
à Dieu seul dans le monde, et je vis que jusque-là je ne
l’avais pas bien comprit. Un attrait par lequel mon cœur fut
subjugué et ravi. Une force qui m’inspira une résolution
généreuse et me mit en quelque sorte dans les mains les
moyens de l’exécuter, car le propre de ces paroles divines est
d’opérer ce qu’elles disent.”</p>

<p class='c005'>We see at once the complete and practical character of her
reaction to the divine; the promptitude with which she makes
the vital connection between intuition and act. <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Teresa
said that the object of the spiritual marriage was “the incessant
production of work.” So for Lucie-Christine that sure
consciousness of the Presence of God which now became
frequent, “clothing and inundating” her as she sat alone at
her sewing or took part in some social activity, called her
above all to “faire les petites choses du dévouement journalier
avec amour”; conquering her natural irritability and dislike
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>for the boredoms and unrealities of a prosperous existence.
“N’avoir jamais l’air ennuyé des autres. Que de fois je
manque à ceci avec les pauvres enfants. Vous êtes ennuyeux!
C’est bien vite dit! Est-ce une amabilité divine?”</p>

<p class='c005'>More and more, as her mystical consciousness grew, the
life of contemplation became her delight; and it was plainly
a real trial to be distracted from it for trivial purposes. In
company, or busied with household duties, she went for
hours with “her soul absorbed, its better part rapt in God.”
She “tried to appear ordinary,” and made excuses if her
abstraction was observed; but there are a few entries in her
journal which will give pleasure to those who condemn
mysticism as an “anti-social type of religion.” “Nous avons
été nous promener, quatorze. Je remarque que d’aller ainsi
avec plusieurs ‘Marthes’ hommes ou femmes, cela ne fait
rien. On laisse discourir, on met un mot de temps en temps,
mais, en définitive, on demeure bien libre et l’oraison va toute
seule. Mais avec une seule Marthe, que c’est terrible! La
tête-à-tête oblige à causer presque tout le temps.”</p>

<p class='c005'>When Lucie wrote this, ten years after her first illuminative
experience, she was far advanced in contemplation. She
had known that direct and ineffable vision of God “Himself
the True, the Good, the Beautiful; all things being nothing
save by Him” which is characteristic—though she knew it
not—of the unitive way: known too the corresponding
experience of dereliction, when the door which had opened on
Eternity seemed tightly closed. It would be tedious to analyze
in detail the rich profusion of mystic states which she had
already exhibited: the degrees of contemplation, ecstasies,
visions and voices, all the forms taken by her growing intuition
of the Transcendent. Many of these can be matched in the
writings of the great mystics. Again and again as we read
her, we are reminded of Angela of Foligno, Ruysbroeck, Julian
of Norwich, Catherine of Genoa, even of Plotinus: yet Lucie-Christine
was at this time ignorant of mystical literature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>and only in later life found with amazement descriptions of
her own experiences in the works of the great contemplatives.</p>

<p class='c005'>These experiences had a wide range. Some we are justified
in regarding as invasions from her deeper self; coming to the
rescue of the often distracted surface personality, and correcting
the impressions of the outer world by its own intimations
of Eternity. Thus, in 1875, she confesses that being particularly
worried by a number of people, the Divine voice said to
her, “Ma fille, il n’y a que toi et moi.” She replied: “Seigneur,
et les autres?” The voice said: “Pour chaque âme en ce
monde il n’y a que moi et elle, toutes les autres âmes et toutes
choses ne sont rien pour elle que par moi et pour moi,” and
by this timely reminder of the one Reality in whose life she
lived, and by and in whom alone all other lives are real, she
was recalled to her inner poise.</p>

<p class='c005'>In assessing the value of this, and many other of her revelations,
we have to remember that Lucie-Christine was a fervent
and exact Churchwoman. Her belief was literal. She
felt no discord between traditional Christianity of the most
concrete kind and the freedom of her own communion with
God. The fruits of that communion were often expressed by
her in theological terms, and the special atmosphere and
tendencies of French Catholicism certainly affected the form
of many of her contemplations. Thus at one end of the scale
her passionate devotion to the Person of Christ, and the fact
that her religious practice centred in the Eucharist, sometimes
resulted in visions of a distinctly anthropomorphic
type. In these, her intuition of God’s presence translated
themselves into hallucinatory images of the Face of Christ,
or of His eyes looking at her; or photisms, which she explained
to herself as the radiance emanating from His person. As we
all know, such dramatizations of mystical emotion are comparatively
commonplace. The elements from which the self
constructs them are by no means all of a spiritual kind; and
experienced mystics agree in regarding them with much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>suspicion. A careful study of Lucie-Christine’s journal
forces us to admit, that the deliberate passivity which she
cultivated often placed her at the mercy of her instinctive
nature; and that its hidden wishes sometimes took a devotional
form. To this source, too, we must refer those “obsessions
and temptations”—in other words, uprushes from the lower
centres—by which she was often attacked during contemplation,
and also the occasionally sentimental and emotional
character of her reactions to the Divine.</p>

<p class='c005'>These objections, however, do not apply to the remarkable
“metaphysical visions”—sharp onsets of real transcendental
consciousness—in which her innate passion for the Absolute
found satisfaction. Then, as she says, God seemed to “put
aside all intermediaries between Himself and the soul;” and
“bathed and irradiated by the Divine substance” she became
“aware of the Divine Abyss,” or perceived, as Julian of Norwich
did, “the Universe in a point,” swallowed up in the simple
yet overwhelming sight of God. Here lie, for us, the real
interest and value of Lucie-Christine’s confessions. She
shares with Angela of Foligno and a few other historical
mystics the double apprehension of the Divine Nature under
its personal and impersonal forms; and as both utterly transcendent
to, yet completely immanent in, the human soul.
In her descriptions of these visions, this woman unread in
philosophy displays a grasp of the philosophic basis of religion
which would do credit to a trained theologian. Thus she says,
“Il n’y a pas, ce me semble, de vue intérieure qui égale celle
de l’essence divine. Mon âme était comme environnée de la
substance divine en laquelle elle voyait ce caractère essentiel
qui nous est révelé par le mystère de la Sainte Trinité, c’est-à-dire
qu’il y a en Dieu l’unité et la distinction, le tout et le
particulier, et je sentais combien c’est folie de chercher quelque
chose en dehors de lui.” Again, “Étant profondément unie
à lui dans la Sainte Communion, je vis Dieu en tant qu’il
est le souverain bien, et je compris en même temps que le mal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>n’est que la négation du bien, un pur <i>néant</i>.... Dans cette
vue intellectuelle, je compris aussi combien sera grande la
confusion des pécheurs quand ils seront jugés, et qu’ils verront
que tout le mal qu’ils ont aimé, préconisé, adoré, se réduit au
néant! Avoir aimé le néant, avoir vécu pour lui, et perdre
pour lui l’Etre éternel!” Here Lucie’s view of sin is that
characteristic of all mystics; who can seldom be persuaded,
however orthodox they may be in other respects, that anything
which is not good is real. We remember how Julian
of Norwich, also a natural contemplative of philosophic
temperament, says, “I saw not sin; for I believe it has no
manner of substance nor part of being.”</p>

<p class='c005'>As an analyzer of her own psychological states, Lucie-Christine
had something of that genius which <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Teresa possessed in
a supreme degree; and she has, perhaps, an added value for us
because she speaks not from the past nor from the cloister,
but out of the Paris of our own day. We owe to her one of
our most vivid descriptions of that apprehension of Eternal
Life—the immersion of our durational existence in the Absolute
Life of God—which Von Hügel regards as the fundamental
religious experience. “J’ai observé,” she says, “que pendant
l’oraison passive et surtout dans l’état d’union, l’âme perd le
sentiment de la durée. Il n’y a plus pour elle de succession
de moments, mais un moment unique, et j’ai cru comprendre
qu’étant élevée à cet état, l’âme y vit selon le mode de vivre
de l’éternité, où il n’y a point de durée, point de passé ni
d’avenir, mais un moment unique, infini.” We have again
to remember that the woman who wrote this had then no
acquaintance with the classics of mysticism. It is her own
impression which she is trying to register.</p>

<p class='c005'>Again, consider this account of the state of divine union
as she had known it: “L’âme va prier, elle s’élance pour
franchir la distance qui la sépare de l’Infini, et cette distance
elle ne la trouve plus! Elle veut aller à vous, mon Dieu, et
vous êtes en elle!... Perdue en vous, elle oublie ellemême
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>et tout le reste, elle ne sait plus comment elle vit, ni
comment elle aime; elle ne voit plus que Vous seul. Encore ne
peut elle pas <i>penser</i> qu’elle vous voit et vous adore; car ce
serait se voir elle-même, et en de tels moments elle ne se voit
pas, elle ne voit que Vous. Elle connaît et aime par un mode
nouveau et incompréhensible, qui est en dehors et infiniment
au-dessus de l’exercice ordinaire de ses facultés. Elle sent
que l’opération de Dieu a pris la place de la sienne et que c’est
Dieu même qui opère en elle la connaissance et l’amour.”</p>

<p class='c005'>This sense of complete surrender to a larger life and greater
power, of which love is the very substance and ground, is
characteristic of nearly all high mystical experience; and the
literature of contemplation would furnish many parallels
to all that Lucie tells us of it. In this state, as she says in
another place, “the thirst of the spirit is suddenly fulfilled
by the Infinite,” and “God takes possession of the ground
of the soul, without passage of time or feeling of space.”
Then, the bewilderment and unrest produced in us by the
disharmonies of daily life are healed. “Là où tout raisonnement
échoue,” she says in one of her most beautiful passages;
“où l’âme est tellement troublée qu’elle ne saurait même
expliquer ce qui la trouble, la divine presence paraît, et soudain
le vertige cesse et la paix renaît avec la lumière.” Consciousness,
ceasing more or less completely its normal correspondences
with the temporal order, then becomes aware
of the eternal and spiritual universe in which we really live.</p>

<p class='c005'>Such an attitude to Eternity was a marked characteristic
of Lucie-Christine’s mysticism. Often, it produced in her the
complete mono-ideism of ecstasy; and she describes the oncoming,
content, and passing of these states with a minuteness
which makes her journal a valuable document for the psychologist.
Constantly, the intense awareness of the Divine
Presence persisted through the many duties and activities
of the day; “like a grave and tender note, dominating all
the modulations of the keyboard of my exterior life.” She is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>not afraid to use the most violent metaphors, the most
concrete images, in her efforts to express the intensity and
reality of this spiritual life that she leads, this divine companionship
that she enjoys. “I am nourished by God’s
substance.” “I breathe the divine essence.” “The presence
of God is so clear that faith is not faith—it is sight.” “The
soul plays within God, as within a limitless universe.” “The
Divine action penetrates and transforms my adoration. It
is the Divine Being who thinks, loves, and lives within me.”
None of the mystics have gone further than this in their
claims; but it is significant that nearly all the greatest go
as far.</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet in all this, Lucie-Christine is strictly Evangelical.
She was a Christian first, and a mystic afterwards. Though
her expressions may seem startling, her mysticism never goes
beyond that of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John and <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul; and her most Platonic
utterances can be justified by the New Testament. But the
Pauline and Johannine teachings on the soul’s union with
Christ are not for her merely doctrinal statements. They are
vivid descriptions of states she has personally known, when her
consciousness truly penetrated to that “région d’amour,
région unique, où l’âme trouve un autre jour, une autre vie,
un autre air respirable, où du moins tous ces éléments latents
se trouvent manifestés, où Dieu seul apparaît, et tout le reste
rentre dans l’ombre.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Such a personal and overwhelming consciousness of “the
greatness, power, and simplicity of God”—an all-inclusive
unity which the unity of her spirit could comprehend—was the
central interest of her life. She certainly tended to that
which Baron von Hügel has called “the vertical relation” with
the Divine. Nevertheless, this theocentric existence did not
involve either the limp passivity or the spiritual selfishness
with which it is sometimes charged. On the ethical side
it committed her to a constant moral discipline; for her ardent
and impulsive temperament reacted too easily to every external
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>stimulus. “I must give up pleasure—never work for my own
enjoyment.” “My one prayer is, that I may not feel joy and
grief so vividly: that I may feel only Thee.” This deliberate
unselfing and concentration on God so strengthened the
fibres of character that she was able to bear with quietness her
many personal sorrows, and the long years of blindness—a
bitter cross for that keen lover of beauty—which closed her
life. Yet it did not muffle her in the unattractive folds of
“holy indifference.” She loved her family devotedly, and
felt without mitigation the anxieties and griefs of human life.
Her attitude to others was generous and sympathetic. God,
she says, gives Himself to us that we may give Him again.
His unique light must pass through the soul as through a
prism; breaking up into the many colours of word and deed,
forgiveness and good counsel, prayer and alms, self-forgetfulness
and self-giving. Though exceedingly reserved about her
spiritual experiences, which were only known to her confessor,
the influence of these experiences was felt by those among
whom she lived; and her house was known by them as “the
house of peace.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Moreover, her love for the institutional and sacramental
side of religion saved her from many of the dangers and extravagances
of individualism. It gave her a framework within
which her own intuitions could find their place; and a valid
symbolism through which she could interpret to herself the
most rarefied experiences of her soul. She is an example of
the way in which the mystic seems able to achieve the universal
without losing or rejecting its particular expression: assimilating
symbols of an amazing crudity without in any way
impairing her vision of truth. The conflict between that
vision and the concrete objectives of popular devotion was
ignored by her; as it is generally ignored by practical mystics
of the institutional type. She, who had touched the Absolute
in her contemplations, was yet deeply impressed by the drama
of the Church; by its ceremonies, holy places, festivals, consecrations.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>Her inner life was nourished by its sacraments.
She displayed the power—so characteristic of Christian
mysticism at its best—of transcending without rejecting the
formulæ of belief as commonly understood; of remaining
within, and drawing life from, the organism, without any
diminution in the proper liberty of the soul.</p>

<p class='c005'>Thus, seen as a whole, Lucie-Christine’s spiritual life has
a richness and balance which reflects the richness and balance
of her own nature; for an impoverished or one-sided character
was never yet found capable of a fully developed and fruitful
mysticism. We see her from girlhood seeking to satisfy her
innate longing for reality; urged on the one hand by the
artist’s craving for perfect loveliness, on the other by the
philosopher’s instinct for Eternity. When the veil was
lifted, and the inner voice said, “God only!” she found at
once the reconciliation and the fulfilment of these two desires.
The long and varied experience which followed was no more
than an unfolding of the content of those words. They
revealed to her the Substance of all beauty and truth; shining
in that world of appearance which she loved to the last with an
artist’s passion, yet ever abiding unchanged in that world of
pure being which she touched in her contemplations “above all
feeling, image, and idea.” Because of this double outlook on
reality, her mysticism was both transcendental and sacramental.
It irradiated the natural world, and also the symbols of
religion, with that simple light of Eternity wherein she found
“all beauties known and unknown, all harmonies natural and
supernatural.” Lucie-Christine makes clear to us, as few
mystics have done, the immense transfiguration of ordinary
life which comes from such an extension of consciousness;
when “the veil suddenly drops, God reveals Himself, and the
soul <i>knows</i> experimentally that which she knew not before.”
Her journal is full of passages in which its joy and splendour
are described. I take one written in a time of great mental
and physical suffering, when the cruel deprivations of blindness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>were already closing in on her, and the two beings she loved
best—her husband and her youngest daughter—had lately
been taken from her by death. “Figurez-vous un pauvre
prisonnier au fond d’un cachot renfermé et obscur, voyant
tout à coup s’entr’ouvrir la voûte de ce cachot, et par là
recevant la lumière du soleil, et aspirant avec force l’air du
dehors qui lui arrive embaumé des senteurs de la vie et de la
chaleur de l’atmosphère resplendissante. Ainsi mon âme
s’ouvrait, et buvait Dieu! ... mon âme aspirait et buvait
la vie même de la Trinité Sainte, et se sentait revivre, et
n’avait plus aucun mal.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>
  <h3 id='chap09-c' class='c010'><abbr title='three'>III</abbr> <br> CHARLES PÉGUY</h3>
</div>
<p class='c003'>In the turmoil and anxieties of the first weeks of the war,
few people observed that France had lost upon the battle-field
one of the greatest of her modern poets; a fearless and
original thinker, a constructive mystic, who exercised a
unique influence over the young writers and thinkers of his
world. Yet the death in action of Charles Péguy, who was
killed on September 5, 1914, at the age of forty-one, removed
a striking figure from contemporary literature, and was
among the chief intellectual losses sustained by France in
the war.</p>

<p class='c005'>Born in Orleans in 1873, of peasant stock, Péguy had
many of the fundamental qualities of the French peasant;
the sturdy independence, the frugal tastes, the untiring
industry, the close kinship with the soil. His father was
a cabinet-maker; his mother that familiar figure of the
cathedrals, the woman who lets the chairs. The great friend
of his boyhood was an old republican carpenter with whom
he used to talk, and to whose conversation he owed his first
political ideas. This heredity and these influences gave to
his thought and attitude a character which he never lost.
In his mature work we see side by side the result of those
two compensating elements in his childish environment;
the mingled mystery and homeliness of that mediæval and
intensely national Catholicism which finds in the French
cathedrals its living symbols, the keen sense of social justice,
of the need for social salvation, which inspired the popular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>republicanism of the years following the Franco-German
war. These characteristics, which afterwards, in a sublimated
form, came to dominate his mysticism and gave to
it its special colour, its mingling of antique tradition with
forward-looking hope, can be traced back to the blend of
Christian and of democratic impressions which he received
as a child. Perhaps only the son of French peasants could
understand and reinterpret as he had done the figure of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Joan of Arc, the peasant girl who saved France; and whose
longing to mend and redeem, at once so practical and so
transcendental, linked up the objectives of social endeavour
and of faith.</p>

<p class='c005'>Brought up within the atmosphere of provincial piety,
Péguy rose from the elementary school to the lycée; and at
nineteen, through his own efforts and his mother’s sacrifices,
passed from Orleans to the University of Paris. There his
vigorous mind and positive character soon made him the
centre of a group of students, over whom he quickly obtained
influence. There, too, he made the transition—almost inevitable
for an ardent young man of his world—from Catholic
orthodoxy to humanitarian socialism: the first stage in his
spiritual pilgrimage, and the first attempt to answer that
question which underlies all his thought and act, his poetry
and controversy—“Comment faut-il sauver?” These words,
which Péguy puts into the mouth of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Joan of Arc, and
shows to us as the mainspring of her actions, define too
the secret impulse of his own career. His mysticism was
not that of the contemplative, the solitary and God-intoxicated
devotee: it was that of a strong-willed man of action,
who sees far off the “mighty beauty” and longs to actualize
it within the common life. He saw that common life with
the eyes of a poet who was also a child of the people; discerning
beneath its surface the dignity and the beauty of
its antique and simple types—the spinner and the tiller,
the housewife, the mother and the child.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>“Les armes de Jésus, c’est la pauvre famille,</div>

      <div class='line'>Le fuseau lourd de laine et la savante aiguille.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>But he found in the French socialism of the ’nineties a dry
and materialistic spirit; which could not satisfy his passionate
idealism, his instinct for a completed life, a universal
redemption, that should harmonize soul and body and fulfil
their needs. Hence, by a process too gradual to be called a
conversion, he grew from humanitarianism into a somewhat
anti-clerical, original, yet mediæval and mystical Catholicism;
in which those ideals and demands which had dominated his
humanitarian period—the sense of the rights and dignity of
mankind, the longing to save, “de porter remède au mal
universel humain”—reappear in a spiritualized form. In
Christianity he saw condensed the saving power of Spirit;
never letting man alone, but redeeming him even in defiance
of his own will, contriving its victories by or in spite of the
evils and disharmonies of life. The belief which he achieved—doubtless
fed by childish memories—was absolute and
literal, and most easily expressed itself in mediæval forms.
Modernism filled him with horror; he desired no attenuation
of the supernatural, no reinterpretation of dogma. The
faith which fought the crusades and built the Cathedrals was
that in which he felt at home, and which he believed himself
destined to bring back to the soul of France: “Au fond,
c’est une renaissance Catholique qui se fait par moi.”</p>

<p class='c005'>Yet his inner life was full of difficulty and unhappiness.
There were in him two strains, two warring impulses, to
which we must attribute many of the griefs and disappointments
of his life: for his great accomplishment both as poet
and as founder of the <i>Cahiers de la Quinzaine</i> brought
him little personal joy. On one side of his nature he was
proud, vehement, combative; full of a destructive energy, an
obstinate fanaticism, which found vent in his violent political
pamphlets, often expressing with the uncouth vigour of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>peasant his uncompromising hates and loves. Though so
ardent a Christian, he was neither meek nor gentle. He
could never resist giving blow for blow, and by his impatience
and intolerance alienated by turns his socialist and Catholic
friends. About 1910, having thus quarrelled with most of
his associates, he withdrew into a voluntary retirement, in
which the spiritual side of his divided temperament seems at
last to have had some opportunity of growth. His mystical
poems—all composed between 1910 and 1913—show to us
the love and exaltation of which he now became capable;
the purity of that vision which had inspired his vigorous
guerilla warfare against the shams and sordidness of modern
life, and which now became the chief factor in his consciousness.
Writing in 1912 to his old friend Joseph Lotte, he says,
“Mon vieux, j’ai beaucoup changé depuis deux ans; je suis
devenu un homme nouveau. J’ai tant souffert et tant prié.
Tu ne peux pas savoir.” The secret of this inner conflict,
of the terrible months during which, as he afterwards confessed,
he was unable to say “Thy will be done,” he revealed
to none; but hints of the way by which he had passed may
be found in his poems. The mystical certitude which inspires
their most beautiful passages seems never to have obtained
complete control of his psychic being. The life of prayer
and the life of personal struggle persisted side by side, not
fully harmonized; and it is doubtful whether he ever achieved
that complete surrender to the divine action “in which alone
we do not surrender our true selves,” which is characteristic
of the developed mystic life. “Celui qui s’abandonne ne
s’abandonne pas, et il est le seul qui ne s’abandonne pas.”
It was surely to himself that Péguy addressed this observation,
and it represents his own central need. Those profound
readjustments of character, that unselfing of the moral nature,
which must precede spiritual unification, and so are the only
foundations of inner peace, had never been accomplished in
him. Like his patroness and heroine <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Joan, he combined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>the temperaments of fighter and dreamer, but he never
succeeded in fusing them in one.</p>

<p class='c005'>We know, too, something of the outward circumstances
which added to his difficulties. Married during his agnostic
period to a freethinker, his intense respect for human freedom
forbade him to force on his wife his own convictions,
or even to bring his adored children to baptism against
their mother’s will. For this refusal he was himself denied
access to the sacraments; and hence this impassioned Catholic,
for conscience’ sake, lived and died out of communion with
the official Church. No one will really understand Péguy’s
position or the meaning of his poems, unless this paradoxical
situation, and this constant element of frustration and incompleteness
in his experience, be kept in mind. He was in
one sense an exile, ever gazing at the beloved country which
he knew and understood so much better than many of its
citizens. Deeply religious, he lived at odds with his religious
world. Capable of the strangest inconsistencies and refusals,
though sparing himself nothing of the anguish they involved,
he could make on foot a pilgrimage to Chartres to pray for
the life of his sick child; yet would not face the struggle
necessary to make those children members of the Church in
which he believed. “Je ne peux pas m’occuper de tout.
Je n’ai pas une vie ordinaire. Nul n’est prophète en son
pays. Mes petits ne sont pas baptisés. A la sainte Vierge
de s’en occuper!”</p>

<p class='c005'>Himself, he felt called upon to devote his powers, without
distraction, to that missionary propaganda in which the
mystical and combative sides of his nature found creative
expression, and to which his poetry and much of his prose
is consecrated. “Il y a tant de manque. Il y a tant à
demander,” says <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Joan to the patient nun who seeks to
teach her resignation: and here she expresses Péguy’s deepest
conviction. There is so much lacking that men might obtain
of joy and peace and love. Action no less than prayer is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>needed; every soul must take its share in meeting the world’s
need, for we are the accomplices of ill if we do nothing to
prevent it. There was never any place in Péguy’s eager and
restless heart for that “other-worldly” mysticism which
achieves the love of God at the expense of love of home and
fellow-men; for religion in his view was an affair of flesh and
blood, not of pure spirit—not merely transcendental, but
concrete, national, fraternal, even revolutionary. On this
side his mysticism represents the spiritualization of that
activist philosophy which was coming into prominence in
the formative years of his life, and could not fail to exert a
powerful influence on him.</p>

<p class='c005'>Both as mystic and as patriot, he had the reformer’s passion:
a measure, too, of the reformer’s violence and intolerant zeal.
He worked for a sweeter and a saner world, a restoration to
man of his lost inheritance. The modern France, he felt,
was wrong. It had lost its hold upon realities; mistaken its
professors and scientists for apostles, its codes and systems
for truth, its political institutions for liberty, the “triumphs
of civilization” for perdurable goods. It had lost freshness,
naïveté, hope: had sacrificed beauty and joy for an
imaginary progress and comfort. In the place of the ancient
types of human worth, the primitive yet august figures of
parent and child, craftsman and tiller of the soil, it had
produced the bemused victim of modern education “avec
sa tête de carton et son cœur de bazar.” In this perversion
of life and cultivation of the second-best he saw the “universal
evil,” which poisons the sources of human happiness.
Yet behind and within it Péguy, visionary and optimist,
discerned the possible restoration of good; mankind brought
back into contact with the real and eternal world. He saw
his beloved France ceasing to be “un peuple qui dit non,”
and becoming, by intensity and harmony of action and vision,
“une race affirmative.” He looked past shams, pretences,
and bad workmanship to a heaven that should contain not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>only people but things: “Dans le paradis tel que je le montrerai,
il n’y aura pas seulement des âmes; il y aura des
choses. Tout ce qui existe et qui est réussi. Les cathédrales,
par exemple. Notre Dame, Chartres, je les y mettrai.”</p>

<p class='c005'>It was such a restoration of humanity to the wholesome and
beautiful life for which it was made, that he had at first sought
in socialism; and the earlier numbers of the <i>Cahiers de la
Quinzaine</i>, of which he was the founder and editor, reflect
this faith. He saw socialism then in its ideal aspect, as a
triumph of justice and love: a reasonable career offered to
the whole race. For this triumph, this reordering of the
common life, he never ceased to work; but a deeper experience
taught him that it could not be effected by any change
imposed on society from without, or any readjustment between
man and man. The readjustment needed was that
between man and God; a change of heart, a rearrangement
of the values of life effected from within, which should make
possible the complete spiritualization of existence. Therefore
it was that Péguy became, in his last and most creative period,
a Christian mystic of an original type; an ardent missionary,
who opposed the intellectualism, materialism, and individualism
which France of the early twentieth century mistook for
progress, by a propaganda which was anti-intellectual,
nationalist, and profoundly Catholic. It is to this period
that his poetry and much of his most vehement prose belongs.
All is didactic in intention; but is saved by its author’s wit,
sincerity, and remarkable imaginative genius from the usual
fate of those who try to turn art to the purposes of edification.
The prose is largely controversial, and inevitably
suffers to some extent from this: for Péguy was violent and
sometimes unjust when attacking the errors and follies of
the time, and had at his disposal an astonishing power of
mockery, irony, and scorn. Yet even here, his instinct for
beauty constantly asserted itself: and in the midst of some
biting attack upon “progressive” politics or modernist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>theology, we get an abrupt invasion of loveliness which transports
us to the atmosphere of his poems. These poems fall
into two groups: first, the three <i>Mystères</i> which he wrote
for the 500th anniversary of the birth of Jeanne d’Arc, “la
sainte la plus grande après Sainte Marie,” and which deal
with her spiritual preparation for the saving of France; <i>La
Charité de Jeanne d’Arc</i> (1910), <i>Le Porche du Mystère de la
Deuxième Vertu</i> (1911), <i>Les Saints Innocents</i> (1912). These
are all written in unrhymed irregular verse; a verse so indefinite
in construction that it is often indistinguishable from
rhythmic prose. They consist chiefly in long meditative
discourses, alternating between the extremes of homeliness
and sublimity, and put into the mouths of Jeanne and of
Madame Gervaise, a Franciscan nun to whom she tells her
problems and her dreams—an apt device for the conveyance
of Péguy’s own religious and patriotic gospel. They were
followed by three volumes in rhymed duodecasyllabic verse,
which he called <i>Tapisseries: Sainte Geneviève et Jeanne
d’Arc</i> (1912), <i>Notre Dame</i> (1913), and <i>Eve</i> (1914), perhaps his
finest and most sustained single work.</p>

<p class='c005'>When we examine these poems in order, we find that we
can trace in them the development of a consistent philosophy
of life: for, like most of the convinced opponents of intellectualism,
Péguy was a profound thinker, relying to a far
greater extent than he would ever have confessed on the
ungodly processes of a singularly acute mind. The deliberate
simplicity of diction, the assumed ingenuousness of attitude
are deceptive, and conceal a deeply reasoned view of the
universe.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

      <div class='line'>“Je n’aime pas, dit Dieu, celui qui pense</div>
      <div class='line'>Et qui se tourmente, et qui se soucie</div>
      <div class='line'>Et qui roule une migraine perpétuelle.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>This is not the doctrine of the charcoal-burner; it is the
doctrine of the experienced philosopher, bitterly conscious
of the limitations of the brain.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>The foundation of his creed is the essentially mystical
belief, so beautifully expressed in <i>Eve</i>, in the solidarity of
the Universe. As humanity is one and indivisible, so too the
human and the divine cannot be separated. “Nous sommes
solidaires des damnés éternels,” he said when he was twenty:
and in his posthumous work <i>Clio</i>, he reiterates the same truth.
“Jésus est du même monde que le dernier des pécheurs;
et le dernier des pécheurs est du même monde que Jésus.
C’est une communion. C’est même proprement cela qui
est une communion. Et à parler vrai ou plutôt à parler
réel il n’y a point d’autre communion que d’être du même
monde.” The spiritual and eternal world, then, is not something
set over against the natural order; but is closely entwined
with it, the neglected element of reality, which alone
can make human existence dignified and sweet.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Car le surnaturel est lui-même charnel</div>
      <div class='line'>Et l’arbre de la grâce est raciné profond</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>What he realizes and points out, therefore, is not some distant
transcendental life and reality, divorced from our normal,
flowing, changing life and reality. Rather he insists on the
beauty and nobility, the deep spiritual quality of this immediate
life; the supernatural character of nature itself,
when seen from the angle of Christian idealism. The Blessed
Virgin is herself:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'>“Infiniment céleste</div>
      <div class='line'>Parce qu’aussi elle est infiniment terrestre.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In Christianity, with its incarnational philosophy, its
balanced cultivation of the active and the mystic life, its
sacramental touch upon all common things, he sees the only
perfect expression of this principle; the only power capable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>of embracing and spiritualizing the whole of the rich complex
of existence. Determined to bring home to his fellow-countrymen,
on the one hand, the concrete and objective
nature of this Christian life, on the other, the simplicity of
soul necessary to those who would understand it, he rejects
all attempts at religious philosophizing or symbolic interpretation.
His treatment of theology is characterized by a
deliberate homely literalness, a naïve use of tradition, which
was intensely exasperating to his agnostic and Modernist
critics; and which may be found distasteful by some religious
minds, unable to realize the intimate connection between gaiety
and faith. To others it will seem that, alone amongst modern
writers, he has recaptured the mediæval secret of familiarity
combined with adoration: of a love, awe, and vision, a profound
earnestness, which yet leave room for laughter. His
picture of God is shamelessly anthropomorphic. (“Je suis
honnête homme, dit Dieu; droit comme un Français.”)
Yet it is full of grave beauty, of the sense of fatherhood,
the mystical consciousness of the Divine desire. Revealed
religion is God’s Word, and therefore means what it says.
“Jésus n’est pas venu pour nous dire des amusettes,” says
Madame Gervaise to Joan of Arc.</p>

<p class='c005'>The faith which Péguy wished to restore to France was not
the religious rationalism of the modernist: still less the
morbid, æsthetic fervour of Huysmans. It was the homely
everyday faith of the past, the humble yet assured relation
with the supernatural order, the courage and hope which is
rooted in tradition and is wholly independent of intellectual
subtleties. “La foi est toute naturelle, toute allante, tout
simple, toute venante”—the great and simple affirmation.
The perfect type of this faith is not the world-weary convert,
but the healthy unselfconscious child; and the child, for
Péguy, is the most holy and most significant figure in the
human group. “C’est l’enfant qui est plein et l’homme qui
est vide.” Only in the child and in those untarnished human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>beings who retain their childlike simplicity of heart do we
see unspoilt humanity: only in the child do we see incarnate
hope. “J’éclate tellement dans ma création,” says God,
“et surtout dans les enfants.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“On envoie les enfants à l’école, dit Dieu.</div>
      <div class='line'>Je pense que c’est pour oublier le peu qu’ils savent.</div>
      <div class='line'>On ferait mieux d’envoyer les parents à l’école.</div>
      <div class='line'>C’est eux qui en ont besoin</div>
      <div class='line'>Mais naturellement il faudrait une école de moi</div>
      <div class='line'>Et non pas une école d’hommes.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The tenderness and charm of those passages in which he
celebrates the importance and sanctity of childhood, its
innocence, its capacity for growth, its virginal outlook, its
freshness and power of response, place him in the front rank
of the poets who have treated this most difficult subject, and
constantly remind us of Blake:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Comme leur jeune regard a une promesse, une secrète assurance intérieure, et leur front, et toute leur personne.</div>
      <div class='line'>Leur petite, leur auguste, leur si révérente et révérende personne....</div>
      <div class='line'>Heureuse enfance. Tout leur petit corps, toute leur petite personne, tous leurs petits gestes, est pleine, ruisselle, regorge d’une espérance.</div>
      <div class='line'>Resplendit, regorge d’une innocence</div>
      <div class='line'>Qui est l’innocence même de l’espérance.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>This hope, the childhood of the heart, is to Péguy the most
precious of human qualities, and the one in which man draws
nearest to an understanding of the Divine Idea. Jesus is
“the man who has hoped,” and the Christian assault, which
is the assault of hope, can alone make a breach in the defences
of eternity. It is “the faith that God loves best”; the
beginning of liberty, the growing point of the eager spirit
of life. Faith beholds that which is: Charity loves that
which is: Hope alone beholds and loves that which shall
be. Faith is static; hope dynamic. Faith is a great tree;
hope is the rising sap, the little, swelling bud upon the spray.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“La petite espérance</div>
      <div class='line'>Est celle qui toujours commence”—</div>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>the persistent element in all effort and all change. She deceives
us twenty times running; yet she is the only one of
our leaders who never deceives us in the end. She gives
significance to human toil, beauty and meaning to human
suffering, reality to human joy. In one of his most beautiful
verses, he describes the crowning of humanity with this
living, budding diadem of hope.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Comme une mère fait un diadème de ses doigts allongés, des doigts conjoints et affrontés de ses deux mains fraîches</div>
      <div class='line'>Autour du front brûlant de son enfant</div>
      <div class='line'>Pour apaiser ce front brûlant, cette fièvre,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ainsi une couronne éternelle a été tressée pour apaiser le front brûlant.</div>
      <div class='line'>Et c’était une couronne de verdure.</div>
      <div class='line'>Une couronne de feuillage.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Moreover, “cette curieuse enfant Espérance” is the motive-power
of the spiritual order too. God Himself hopes for and
in man: has placed His eternal hope in man’s hands, and
given to him, along with the gift of liberty, the terrible
power of frustrating or achieving the purposes of Divine
Love.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Le plus infirme des pécheurs peut découronner, peut couronner</div>
      <div class='line'>Une espérance de Dieu.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Such a freedom is the very condition of spirituality; for
faith, hope, and charity are not servile virtues, but heavenward-tending
impulses of the free soul, activities of the will.
Here lies their value; since only in true love, voluntary
service, deliberate choice, can the possibilities of human
nature be fulfilled:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Toutes les soumissions d’esclaves du monde, ne valent pas un beau
regard d’homme libre.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Therefore, for the author of this gospel of freedom and
hope, the course of salvation takes an exactly opposite course
to that described by Huysmans and his school. The typical
soul for Péguy is not the “twice-born” exhausted and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>fastidious sensualist Durtal, driven at last to seek reconciliation
by his overwhelming sense of sin. It is the “once-born”
simple and ardent peasant child, Joan of Arc; brought
straight from the sheepfold to serve the heroic purposes of
God.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Tenant tout un royaume en sa ténacité</div>
      <div class='line'>Vivant en plein mystère avec sagacité</div>
      <div class='line'>Mourant en plein martyre avec vivacité</div>
      <div class='line'>La fille de Lorraine à nulle autre pareille.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>The typical experience is an experience of growth, freshness,
novelty; action rightly directed, and a vision which
perceives beauty and dignity in the antique and homely
labours of the race. The cultivator of the earth and the
rearer of children, the faithful priest, the strong and loyal
soldier—of these is the kingdom of heaven. Of these and
by these the old France was built up; and through these
ideals and virtues, and the national saints in whom they
are expressed, the new France may be saved. With Huysmans
in our mystical moments we are usually inside a church,
assisted by incense and plain-chant of the best quality: with
Péguy, we are in the open air, in the market garden, or in
the nursery. There his poetry, in Francis Thompson’s
beautiful image, “plays at the foot of the Cross.” Even the
Holy Innocents in heaven are playing at bowling hoops with
their palms and crowns. “At least, I think so,” says God,
“for they never asked <i>My</i> permission.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Tel est mon paradis.... Mon paradis est tout ce qu’il y a de plus simple.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Side by side with Péguy’s spiritual gospel, or rather entwined
with it, goes his practical and patriotic gospel. Since
for him the whole of life was crammed with spiritual significance,
he saw in the patriotic passion a sacrament of heavenly
love, and in earthly cities symbols of the City of God. Hence
nationalism was to him, as to Dostoevsky, essentially religious,
and Joan of Arc—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>was the perfect saint, fusing the two halves of human experience
in one whole. These two aspects of love he could not
separate, for they seemed to him equally the flowers of a
completed life. Even God, he thought, would find it difficult
to decide between them.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Dans une belle vie, il n’est que de beaux jours,</div>

      <div class='line'>L’amour de la patrie après l’amour de Dieu.“</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>This mystical patriotism was his great gift to the mind of
France; and it was to her regeneration that his work was
really consecrated. It was the ideal France, the “eldest
daughter of God,” which claimed his devotion and inspired
his finest verse. She is the creative nation, planter of gardens
and sower of seeds, the nation which turns all things to the
purposes of more abundant life:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ici, dit Dieu, dans cette douce France, ma plus noble création,</div>
      <div class='line'>Dans cette saine Lorraine,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ici ils sont bons jardiniers....</div>

      <div class='line'>Honnête, modeste, ordonné.</div>
      <div class='line'>C’est là que j’ai cueilli mes plus belles âmes.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Péguy saw France in the laborious and heroic past, with
her ancient traditions of culture, liberty, and order: patient,
scrupulous, diligent, tending her seedbeds and weeding her
fields—for good work was always in his eyes the earnest of
a healthy soul. He hoped for her in the future: a future to
be conditioned, not by the progressive character of her
political institutions, but by her freshness, her eternal youth;
above all, by her spirit of hope.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>“Peuple, les peuples de la terre te dirent léger</div>
      <div class='line'>Parce que tu es un peuple prompt....</div>
      <div class='line'>Mais moi, je t’ai pesé, dit Dieu, et je ne t’ai point trouvé léger.</div>
      <div class='line'>O peuple inventeur de la cathédrale, je ne t’ai point trouvé léger en foi.</div>
      <div class='line'>O peuple inventeur de la croisade, je ne t’ai point trouvé léger en charité.</div>
      <div class='line'>Quant à l’espérance, il vaut mieux ne pas en parler, il n’en a que pour eux.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Owing everything to the love and industry of his mother
and grandmother—for his father died before his birth—it
was natural that Péguy should find in faithful and laborious
womanhood the ultimate types of human truth and goodness.
Two such types appear again and again in his poems,
as living symbols of the national soul: <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Geneviève, “vigilante
bergère, aïeule et paroissienne,” whose prayer and
fortitude saved Paris, and, above all, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Joan of Arc, “enfant
échappée à de pauvres familles,” in whom the dual
love of God and man, carried into vigorous action, availed to
change the history of France. In the three <i>Mystères</i> which
he wrote in her honour, he extols the three qualities in which
he found the secret of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Joan’s holiness, significance, and
power; her ardent charity, her unquenchable hope, the childlike
innocence of her soul. Charity, the passionate longing
to help and save, urged her to rescue France from its miseries.
“Il y a tant de manque, il y a tant à demander.” In this
profound sense of ill to be mended, her mission, and in Péguy’s
view the mission of all Christians, takes its rise. Hope, the
ever-renewed belief in a possible perfection, “invisible et
immortelle et impossible à éteindre,” gave her courage to
obey her Voices and strength to perform apparently impossible
acts. Because she was a child at heart, with a
child’s unsullied outlook, simplicity and zest—its entire
aloofness from the unreal complications of adult existence—she
had an assurance, a freshness, a power of initiative, which
carried her through and past the superhuman difficulties of
her task:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>

      <div class='line'>A peine au débarqué de son premier village.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'><abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Joan thus appears as the supreme example of the practical
mystic; rooted in the soil, and agent of that saving force
which will never rest until it has resolved the discords of
man’s life and inducted him into the kingdom of reality.
She is for Péguy not only the redeemer and incarnate soul
of France, but also, in her spirit of prayer and her militant
vigour, the leader and patron of all those initiates of hope
who “seek to mend the universal ill.”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c007'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Heureux ceux d’entre nous qui la verront paraître</div>
      <div class='line'>Le regard plus ouvert que d’une âme d’enfant,</div>

      <div class='line'>Rassemblera sa troupe aux pieds de notre maître.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>It is easy enough to exhibit Péguy’s defects, both literary
and temperamental. Among the first we must reckon his
tiresome mannerisms and apparent absence of form, his
digressions and lapses into the didactic, his exaggerated love
of repetition: the way in which his verse, in such a poem as
<i>Eve</i>, seems to advance by means of passionate reiterations,
stanza after stanza, like the waves of one tide, distinguished
only by the smallest verbal changes. On the temperamental
side we must acknowledge his intractable arrogance, a complete
want of sympathy with his opponents’ point of view,
something too of the morose distrustfulness of the peasant:
faults which persisted side by side with his real mystical
enthusiasm, for his nature never completely unified itself.
On one side a spiritual poet, on the other side he was and
remained to the last a violent and often cruel pamphleteer:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>carrying on against both private enemies and public movements
a guerilla warfare in which he seemed to himself to
be, like his patroness, fighting the cause of his Voices and of
the right. As with most poets who are also missionaries,
apostolic zeal sometimes got the better of artistic discretion.
In the fury of his invective against the folly, priggishness,
cowardice, and love of comfort of the modern world, he seized
any image that came to hand; sometimes with disconcerting
effect. No other poet, perhaps, would have dared to introduce
cachets of antipyrine into his indignant catalogue of
our weaknesses and crimes. Yet, as against this, what
other poet of our day has achieved so wide a sweep of emotion;
has revealed to us so great and so earnest a personality?
When we consider his range, the tender simplicity of his
passages on little children, the sublime Hymn to the Virgin
and Address to Night in <i>La Deuxième Vertu</i>, the solemn yet
ardent celebration of “les armes de Jésus”—suffering,
poverty, failure, death—in <i>La Tapisserie de Sainte Geneviève</i>;
and Eve, with its alternate notes of irony and exaltation, its
exquisite concluding rhapsody on <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Geneviève and <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Joan of Arc, the “two shepherdesses of France”—then we
forget the sermons and the diatribes, and we feel that the
world lost in Péguy a great Christian poet. He died, as we
may be sure that he would have wished to do, in defence of
the country which he so passionately loved: and a strangely
poignant interest attaches to those verses in his last published
work which he devotes to the “poor sinners” redeemed
by this most sacred of deaths:</p>
